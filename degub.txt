[{"cluster": 0, "articles": [{"author": "John Biggs", "title": "After Silk Road", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 22:40:30", "content": "After Silk\u00a0Road The Internet routes around damage. With the fall of the Silk Road \u00a0comes the inevitable expectation that the underbelly of the Internet is somehow cut and something important has been removed like a dark organ of indeterminate worth and function. This is not true. As we well know, the Silk Road was not the first nor the last online market \u2013 even as the Feds celebrate their victory the Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded are angling for the crown \u2013 but the destruction of the Silk Road and, to a degree, the recent comments by the Lavabit founder, show how deeply we trust the Internet with our secrets and how readily it gives them up. We know, now, with certainty that nearly nothing is safe. However, we also know that modern encryption techniques can keep prying eyes out of nearly everything we see or do. Sites like the Silk Road are brought down by carelessness and hubris rather than technical know-how and I\u2019m sure the FBI understands as much about the security systems put in place to protect clients as any other educated amateur. It is at the intersection of human frailty and rock-hard encryption that we find ourselves at a crossroads. The great machines can keep enemies at bay as long as the gatekeeper remembers to close the door. Can we trust the cloud and can we trust anonymous services to truly keep us anonymous? Yes. However, the caveat is that when that trust is broken, it is broken catastrophically, taking down a swathe of the Internet with it. One part of the Silk Road fallout that I found particularly interesting was the site\u2019s seemingly apocryphal ability to jettison deposited Bitcoin back to the owners in the event of a raid. While this behavior hasn\u2019t been documented \u2013 it\u2019s all rumor right now \u2013 it would be an amazing solution for future systems. By learning from the mistakes of Ulbricht and the like, we can build stronger and better systems for the dissemination of information. While I don\u2019t support what went on on the Silk Road \u2013 the hacking services and illegal gun trading alone made it more like the Wild West than Utopia, not to mention the alleged murder-for-hire plots \u2013 I do support its right to exist. No government should be able to shut down a conglomeration of like-minded people who wish to do business anonymously. We cannot judge the pot dealer or the LSD buyer any more than they can judge our habits and predilections. The morality of this can be debated but the right to an anonymous exchange cannot. The Silk Road isn\u2019t dead. The FBI knows that, Ulbricht knows it, the users know it. Just as the death of Napster didn\u2019t stop the trafficking in downloaded music, this will not stop the trafficking in Bitcoin. Someone with a similar bent will build another Silk Road and another, eventually creating a machine that can bar the door without the gatekeeper\u2019s intervention. Then, it seems, we\u2019ll simply have to deal with a machine that refuses us entry because of our foibles and foolishness. The destruction of the Silk Road will teach the authorities a thing or two about Bitcoin and encryption but it will teach future Dread Pirate Roberts important lessons in evasion and obfuscation.", "lede": "After Silk\u00a0Road The Internet routes around damage.

Basically it\u2019s a network of websites that are hosted on a network reachable only by people who use Tor, which stands for The Onion Router. You can read about it here . Tor\u2019s origins lie in a project at the U.S. Naval Academy , and the point then was research into new ways of protecting government communications from the encroachments of hackers and spies. Here\u2019s how I understand how it works: When using a Tor-enabled browser, the traffic between your computer and the server that hosts the website you\u2019re visiting travels through a randomized network of nodes that comprise the Tor network. No single link in the traffic chain can be used to link back to you, making it a pretty good tool for staying anonymous (when used properly). In time, the research project moved to the open-source community, and now software that enables use of the Tor network is freely available to anyone: Bad guys selling drugs and guns, political activists trying to obfuscate their communications from a repressive government, or police doing surveillance work. Here\u2019s a screen grab of the Tor network I used today, which was created using a program called Vidalia. Today I downloaded a Tor Browser Bundle that contains both Vidalia, which sets up the network, and a tweaked version of the Firefox Web browser. You can find versions that work for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, several of which are customized for different languages, here . After installing, I had what I was told was an anonymized connection to the Web \u2014 that is, the conventional Web. \u201cCongratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor,\u201d a welcome page said. I could search Google for something to help me carry out a criminal act or post a message on some forum without having to worry about any of it ever being traced back to me. In practice, using a browser in this manner is slower than you\u2019re probably used to. All that extra traffic to obfuscate your actual IP address and location takes its toll on the experience. So don\u2019t expect the same zippy Web you\u2019d likely enjoy without all the Tor infrastructure. Otherwise, it was just like using a conventional browser. But here\u2019s where the Dark Web comes in. That same cloak of anonymity that works for an individual browser also works for someone who wants to host a website. There is a pseudo top-level domain known as .onion that is not part of the global domain name registry but that works with Tor-enabled browsers. There\u2019s a Wikipedia article here that gets into more of the technical nitty gritty if you\u2019re interested, but the main thing to know is that these addresses are weird, hard to memorize and probably change regularly, so your mileage may vary. For example, the old address of Silk Road was http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion. (And if you\u2019re still a little behind the curve on what the whole deal was with Silk Road, it\u2019s worth reading Adrian Chen\u2019s piece about it for Kotaku.com from 2011 .) So I went looking around to see what I could find on the Dark Web. My first stop was a site called TorLinks that is a list of sites operating in the .onion domain space. There I found links for what appeared to be a bit of a seedy and primitive underbelly of the Internet. But at the same time, when you look at them, it\u2019s hard not to imagine that the whole thing is some kind of put-on. Topping the list were \u201cfinancial services,\u201d or sites advertising services related to Bitcoin , the untraceable digital currency that is apparently the coin of the realm in this corner of the Internet. I also found working links to two sites offering counterfeit currency: One offered $5,000 worth of fake American $50 bills for the Bitcoin equivalent of $2,000; another offered 6,000 fake euro notes in 50 euro denominations for 1,900 euro worth of Bitcoin. There\u2019s also a \u201cservices\u201d section. One site advertises a \u201crent-a-hacker\u201d service. Another sells fake passports and ID cards. It turns out that Ross Ulbricht, the 29-year-old San Francisco man whom the FBI arrested for operating the Silk Road site, had attracted the attention of the Department of Homeland Security when he ordered a bunch of fake IDs delivered to his home. There\u2019s even a site offering contract killings in the U.S., Canada and the European Union. The going rate: $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in the U.S. and Canada, $12,000 in Europe. And yes, it totally looked like a put-on. But then, what do I know? You\u2019ll just have to find out for yourselves, but you can probably imagine what\u2019s there: Guns, ammo, drugs, porn, stolen credit card numbers, etc. There are links to numerous message forums dedicated to revolutionary politics and wacky conspiracy theories. You get the idea. It reminded me of the early 1990s-era Internet, before the Web itself was mainstream, but not in a good way. There\u2019s also a search engine called Torch that claims to have indexed 117,367 pages in the .onion space. Some searches I did worked, some timed out. Again, your mileage may vary. After a couple hours of exploration I got thoroughly bored. You probably will, too.

Ross William Ulbricht ordered the hit against an employee who took delivery of a kilogram of cocaine valued at $27,000, according to a superseding indictment filed in federal court in Maryland . Shortly after receipt, the employee came under suspicion of stealing from other Silk Road members after he was arrested by law enforcement authorities, prosecutors said. Communicating with an undercover law enforcement agent posing as a drug smuggler, Dread Pirate Roberts\u2014the online moniker prosecutors say Ulbricht used as leader of Silk Road\u2014first asked that the suspected employee be beaten and forced to return the stolen Bitcoins. Soon, the indictment alleged, the kingpin changed his mind. \"Can you change the order to execute rather than torture?\" Ulbricht allegedly asked in January. The employee\u2014who prosecutors said had access to private messages sent by all Silk Road users including its boss\u2014\"was on the inside for a while, and now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info.\" Dread Pirate Roberts, who agreed to pay $40,000 in advance and another $40,000 when the hit was completed, said that he had \"never killed before, but it is the right move in this case,\" the indictment added. On February 4, Dread Pirate Roberts allegedly transferred $40,000 into a bank account controlled by the undercover agent. On March 1, Dread Pirate Roberts had the remainder deposited into the account after he received a staged photo that purported to depict the body of the employee who had died of asphyxiation and heart rupture after being tortured. \"I'm pissed I had to kill him ... but what's done is done,\" Dread Pirate Roberts allegedly wrote after receiving the image. \"I just can't believe he was so stupid. I just wish more people had some integrity.\" \u201cThis kind of behavior is unforgivable to me\u201d The indictment isn't the first court document to level chilling murder-for-hire allegations against Ulbricht. A separate 39-page criminal complaint claims that two months later Ulbricht ordered a $150,000 hit on a Silk Road user known as FriendlyChemist. The murder was ordered after FriendlyChemist hacked into the computer of a large Silk Road drug dealer and provided Ulbricht with a sample of usernames, addresses, and order information to prove it. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the data unless he was paid $500,000. \"This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me,\" Ulbricht told a Silk Road user named redandwhite, according to the complaint. \"Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.\" Referring to the hit, he went on to say \"it doesn't have to be clean.\" There is no evidence the hit was ever carried out. Authorities in White Rock, British Columbia, where Dread Pirate Roberts said FriendlyChemist lived with a wife and three children, have no record of a homicide occurring on March 31, the date redandwhite told Dread Pirate Roberts the man was executed.

Concerned by reports about a wide-open marketplace operating as a kind of stoner\u2019s Amazon, the two senators demanded action. The Silk Road kept chugging along, but the senators\u2019 June 8, 2011 letter had an immediate effect somewhere else: in the world of Bitcoin, the digital currency that helps drive the Silk Road. Bitcoin prices promptly went over a cliff, dropping by two-thirds over the next three days. And they kept drifting downwards for months after that. The plunge seemed to confirm that the fates of the Silk Road and Bitcoin were intertwined. Nobody really knew how big a part of the Bitcoin economy the Silk Road really played. But then the feds shuttered the Silk Road this past Wednesday, and now it\u2019s pretty clear, thanks to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Christopher Tarbell, the special agent who signed the complaint against alleged Silk Road mastermind, Ross Ulbricht. From February 2011 to July 2013, there were 1.2 million transactions on the site, accounting for 9.5 million bitcoins. That\u2019s about 4 percent of the 225 million bitcoin transactions that happened on Bitcoin\u2019s public block chain over the same period. The marketplace connected about 150,000 buyer accounts with just under 4,000 sellers. That means that the Silk Road was a very big player in the Bitcoin world, but maybe not the giant that some suspected it was . The relationship between Bitcoin and Ulbricht is clearer too, thanks to court documents that depict Ulbricht as a fan of Austrian Economic Theory and serious Bitcoin trader. According to prosecutors, Ulbricht was \u201cAltoid,\u2019 a frequent poster to Bitcoin forums. Altoid often boasted about buying low and selling high in Bitcoin exchanges. And when Silk Road launched, bitcoin was its only method of payment. Since that time, legitimate bitcoin use has grown, and the bitcoin economy has diversified. There\u2019s still a lot of gambling and speculation. But now you can buy groceries or electronics or cupcakes, or even pay for a cab with bitcoins Although bitcoin took a big drop on the news of the Silk Road bust this Wednesday, it bounced back pretty quickly. So while bitcoins were down 66 percent two years ago on the mere mention of a Silk Road closure, when the F.B.I. finally came knocking, it only bashed the digital currency by about 7 percent. That\u2019s not much worse than a typical day for bitcoin, which has moved about 2.7 percent per day, on average, since it had its big run-up this past spring, according to data compiled by Bitcoin analysis site, The Genesis Block, which has posted an interesting analysis of the relationship between bitcoin and the Silk Road . \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is there\u2019s a huge shift towards this legitimate economy,\u201d says Greg Schvey the Genesis Block\u2019s head of research. In fact, the feds would probably have had a harder time investigating the Silk Road if it had been a cash-based network, says Patrick Murck, a lawyer for the Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit group that is working to steer bitcoin into the mainstream. \u201cIt highlights some things that we\u2019ve been saying all along,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t this magical anonymous currency that helps people with illegal activity.\u201d", "lede": "Two years ago, Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchi...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/10/silk_road/"}]}, {"cluster": 1, "articles": [{"author": "None", "title": "Yahoo, Singapore Press Holdings Settle Copyright Suit", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-01 03:12:23", "content": "Answers allows you to tap the knowledge of Community members.

And so it didn\u2019t. The new GoPro Hero3+ cameras add a few improvements to the already-excellent Hero3 lineup, and although the changes are conservative, they\u2019re welcome. The new Hero3+ lineup is smaller, lighter, and has a longer-lasting battery than last year\u2019s Hero3. In short: The new Hero3+ lineup is smaller (GoPro says 20 percent smaller, but there are no dimensions listed on the company\u2019s site), lighter (20 percent is quoted again, but the Hero3+ has the same 2.6 oz. weight listed as its predecessor), and has a longer-lasting battery than last year\u2019s Hero3. GoPro says the camera\u2019s battery life has been increased by 30 percent, which would put it at about 1.5 to 2 hours per charge instead of 1 to 1.5 hours. Functionally, there\u2019s not a lot different. That\u2019s largely a good thing. Built-in Wi-Fi is included in all the new models, and the highest-end Black Edition comes bundled with its own remote. According to the company, interaction with the GoPro mobile app and streaming video to devices are speedier with the new cameras too. Other than that, they have the same respectable F2.8 aperture and fixed focal length as the last generation, but GoPro is touting the enhanced sharpness of the new optics. The Black Edition cameras also boast a mode that automatically optimizes exposure in low-light situations. And, of course, the cameras are still practically everything-proof: They\u2019re waterproof down to 131 feet, and they can handle being pilloried by waves and bears . Like its predecessor, the highest-end Hero3+ Black Edition shoots 4K video footage (3840 x 2160), but that feature isn\u2019t as exciting as it sounds. A maximum capture rate of 15 frames per second essentially makes the 4K moot; video may look more detailed, but 15fps is choppy as hell. It\u2019s a head-scratching limitation as the Hero3+ Black Edition can shoot 12-megapixel stills at 30fps. If 4K footage is basically a string of 8-megapixel stills strung together, shouldn\u2019t 4K at 30fps be achievable with the same camera? I\u2019m no scientist, but it seems like it. Much more exciting is the fact that in plain old 1080p mode, the Hero 3+ lineup captures at a smooth 60fps. That\u2019s not exactly new either \u2014 the Hero3 Black Edition did that as well. All the Hero3+ models also record high-speed/super-slow-motion 720p video at 120fps and 640 x 480 resolution video at 240fps. There are three variations in the new GoPro Hero3+ lineup. The Hero3+ Black Edition ($400) is the flagship model, with a 12-megapixel sensor, 4K video capture capabilities, the new low-light mode, and a remote. The identically priced Hero3+ Black Edition Surf is the same camera with surf mounts included. And the Hero3+ Silver Edition drops the price down to $300, but it has a lower-resolution 10-megapixel sensor, a slower burst mode that tops out at 10fps, and it lacks the 4K video mode and bundled remote.", "lede": "Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/10/new-gopro-cameras/"}]}, {"cluster": 2, "articles": [{"author": "Ina Fried", "title": "Facebook Tries to Make Its Home More Inviting by Welcoming Photos From Other Services", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:00:06", "content": "Aiming to make its mobile environment more attractive to Android users, Facebook announced on Thursday that it will start allowing Facebook Home users to see photos and posts from Flickr, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram from their lock screen.

Facebook Facebook revealed plans Wednesday to build a $120 million, 394-unit housing community near its Menlo Park, California, offices. The development, named Anton Menlo, will in part address the housing shortage in the area\u2014employees often inquire about where they should live, according to\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal \u2014but it will also operate as a semi-self-contained community with a number of amenities, among them a very short commute time to work. All but 15 of the apartments will be open to non-Facebook employees, and Facebook is retiring about the community\u2019s prospects as a perk for employees. But the company worked with a San Francisco developer to ape the style of Facebook\u2019s own headquarters in Menlo Park so that, in theory, employees would have a seamless transition between the \u201chome\u201d of work and the \u201chome\u201d of home. Aside from apartments, the area will include a convenience store, sports pub, bike repair shop, yoga studio, pool, cafe, and doggy daycare services. Construction is expected to take at least two years. As the WSJ points out, the community echoes the concept of company towns that had a brief surge of popularity around the start of the twentieth\u00a0century. Business moguls like George Pullman and Andrew Carnegie constructed fully realized towns for their working-class employees to live in, collecting them all in the same place and keeping them convenient to their work sites. Company towns tended to be isolated from other social communities, and workers outside of them would be isolated from each other. Inside the towns there were social events, schools, and even hospitals. But with the convenience came added social pressure : the company towns were a breeding ground for middle-class values\u2014house ownership and families in a close-knit community\u2014that compelled the employees to stay put. Facebook employees are unlikely to be as prone to feeling a need to move up in the world the way steel workers living in Carnegie\u2019s company town might have. The Facebook employee\u2019s burden is more likely to be a home life built to mirror a work life, among colleagues, that extends a long work day even further. And Anton Menlo seems better suited to housing young engineers than families, with only a handful of three-bedroom apartments. Over half of the residences are one-bedrooms. Corporate housing is not an unfamiliar concept for large companies, especially tech companies. Employers like Microsoft and Amazon often provide housing options for their interns and temporary placements for employees who are in town or migrating to the area. But Facebook\u2019s move to provide its employees with a permanent, community-focused housing solution is unusual. Still, big tech companies often become part of the landscape without the company having to build itself apartments. And Facebook's future apartments won't even accommodate that many of the Menlo Park employees, only 10 percent or so. But company housing is a concept that is not really \"done\u201d anymore; the closest modern analogy might be the Foxconn and Pegatron dorms,\u00a0 infamous for housing the factory workers who make Apple products in less-than-desirable conditions, or the Olympic Village that puts up athletes while the games are on. And Facebook's apartments might encourage more of the mixing Steve Jobs targeted when he proposed only two bathrooms for Pixar\u2019s campus. If employees hanging out in luxury common areas with beer and frozen yogurt on the Facebook campus proper are generating good ideas, perhaps half-asleep employees crossing paths while taking the trash out in their pajamas will generate even better ones.", "lede": "A rendering of Anton Menlo, the apartments Facebook plans to buil...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/10/the-houses-that-facebook-built-are-coming-to-san-francisco/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Facebook's Company Town", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:41:10", "content": "Facebook Inc.'s sprawling campus in Menlo Park, Calif., is so full of cushy perks that some employees may never want to go home. Soon, they'll have that option. The social network said this week it is working with a local developer to build a $120 million, 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices. Called Anton Menlo, the 630,000 square-foot rental property will include everything from a sports bar to a doggy day care. Facebook Inc.'s sprawling campus in Menlo Park, Calif., is so full of cushy perks that some employees may never want to go home. Soon, they'll have that option. Reed Albergotti has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Facebook Even in Silicon Valley, where tech companies compete to lure coveted engineers with over-the-top perks and offices that resemble adult playgrounds, Facebook's plan breaks new ground. A Facebook spokeswoman said employee retention wasn't a major factor in the real estate push. \"We're certainly excited to have more housing options closer to campus, but we believe that people work at Facebook because what they do is rewarding and they believe in our mission,\" she said. The Facebook Life Amenities for residents of an apartment building Facebook is constructing near its campus: On-site cafe, convenience store, and sports pub Bicycle repair shop with onsite storage Pet spa with doggy day care, pet walking services, dog park Resort-inspired pool, spa and cabana area Indoor/outdoor wellness, yoga and training facility with personal training Rooftop entertainment deck with three-themed areas Some employees had inquired about places to live near the corporate campus, she said, amid a housing shortage in Menlo Park. Real estate prices are skyrocketing in Silicon Valley, and in San Francisco, up 24% in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the Bay Area, according to DataQuick , a real-estate data firm. The development conjures up memories of so-called \"company towns\" at the turn of the 20th century, where American factory workers lived in communities owned by their employer and were provided housing, health care, law enforcement, church and just about every other service necessary. Spending more time in the clutches of the company sphere isn't necessarily positive. One reason the old company towns eventually disappeared was that they could be overbearing to workers. In the 2013 version, the downside could be unspoken expectations that employees always be working. Facebook's plans are still a far cry from those steelworker and mining company towns from a century ago. Facebook employees aren't expected to work there for their entire lives. And the new development can only house a maximum of about 10% of its Menlo Park employees. But the move speaks to how competition is reshaping the role of corporate culture in the tech industry. \"Silicon Valley is in many ways the antithesis of the company town,\" said Ajay Agrawal, a professor of entrepreneurship at University of Toronto. In today's tech industry, Mr. Agrawal says, employees feel less tied to a company, and more tied to the geographical location and industry. They're more likely to switch companies and collaborate on ideas with people outside their own corporation. One of the downsides of the Silicon Valley model, Mr. Agrawal says, is that if companies believe their employees will likely leave, they won't invest as much in their lives or their development. \"There may be some optimal level between the extreme company town,\" he says, \"and Silicon Valley, where everyone is moving companies.\" To build the housing, Facebook's \"amenities team\" worked with developer St. Anton Partners, a San Francisco Bay area, multi-family real estate developer, to create an environment that mirrors the atmosphere of its corporate campus, where employees are encouraged to mingle and share ideas. The apartments will go for market rates, and a handful will be set aside for low income residents. All but 15 of the units will be open to non-Facebook employees. \"The beauty of this thing is that it's extremely close to our campus,\" said John Tenanes, Facebook's director of real estate and an architect involved in the planning. \"It's a five-minute bike ride\" along a dedicated path that runs along the San Francisco bay, he said. \"You don't even have to put on the brakes.\" One of Facebook's corporate goals is to take care of as many aspects of its employees lives as possible. They don't have to worry about transportation\u2014there's a bus for that. Laundry and dry cleaning? Check. Hairstylists, woodworking classes, bike maintenance. Check. At Facebook, the company's headquarters are supposed to feel more like a college campus than an office. The 56-acre parcel, which it moved to in December 2011, will soon be connected to a new wing, designed by architect Frank Gehry. There is a winding asphalt road that runs through the center of campus where employees glide through on bicycles. Throughout the workday, programmers bond with advertising product developers over free lattes or ice cream, walking around the sculptures and shops, or lounging on sun-drenched grassy knolls and park benches. There is a company game day, where employees run the three-legged race. At night, employees watch movies on a giant, stadium-style outdoor television screen that looms over an open plaza in the middle of campus. Lauryn Hale, a Harvard Business School graduate who was hired by Facebook in 2010, said all the amenities take some stress out of the daily job and allow her to think more creatively. Her favorite thing to do is have a \"walking meeting\" with another employee, but only after grabbing a frozen yogurt at the sweet shop. \"I probably love that too much\" she says.

And, truth be told, the show wasn\u2019t that impressive \u2014 especially if you watched Facebook perform the same fiscal kabuki before it went public last year. It makes a lot of sense to compare Facebook and Twitter. Each company went through about eight years of life before going public \u2014 give or take six months \u2014 and each runs a fast-growing, Silicon Valley-based social network with a global footprint and a heavy dependence on advertising. But financially speaking, there\u2019s a massive gulf between them: One is a reliable profit gusher while the other is an anemic mess. First, credit where credit is due: Twitter is a growth machine. It tripled sales in 2012 and it more than tripled in 2011, and in most of the last six quarters, it grew its active user base by more than 10 percent. More than 65 percent of its advertising appears on mobile devices, a particularly important, fast-growing market. Revenue went from $28 million in 2010 to $317 million last year, giving Twitter significantly better revenue growth in the years leading up to its IPO than Facebook. The trouble is, losses are growing too. They grew to $69 million for the half-year ended June 30 versus $49 million in the same period last year, extending a streak that has seen Twitter lose money in every year of operation it has disclosed. Facebook, in contrast, posted steadily rocketing profits for the three years leading up its S-1. Then there are the absolute numbers, which make Twitter\u2019s little-bird mascot seem apt. By the time Facebook went public, it was posting $1 billion in annual profit on $3.7 billion in revenue from 845 million monthly users. So Twitter is less than one-tenth the company Facebook was when it went public, in terms of sales. It\u2019s less than one-third the company Facebook was in terms of users, claiming 218 million monthlies. And it\u2019s infinitely worse from a bottom-line perspective, since it\u2019s still losing money, $79 million last year. The silver lining there is that losses narrowed between 2011 and 2012. But sadly, they widened this year, by 41 percent in the first six months. It\u2019s also worth noting that Twitter\u2019s user growth is slowing, to 7 percent in the most recent quarter from roughly 10 to 11 percent in prior quarters. But in fairness to the Twitter: Facebook also saw monthly user growth decline in the last quarter contained in its own S-1 \u2014 though this was across a much larger user base. The trouble with Twitter, then, is that its growth seems to have been stunted. Seven and a half years after launch, it\u2019s not only still losing lots of money, but it\u2019s also a small fraction of the company Facebook was eight years after launch. This despite some big advantages, like free content from global mega-celebrities ranging from the presidents of the United States and Russia to stars like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey (to say nothing of Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga). Then there\u2019s the $1.1 billion in venture funding that has been lavished on the company at generous valuations. Twitter\u2019s arrested development makes sense when you consider it ran through three different CEOs while Facebook was run by just one. The optimistic interpretation of Twitter\u2019s much weaker growth story is that over the past three years, under CEO Dick Costolo, the company finally stopped screwing up and put itself on an excellent trajectory that is bound to continue given Twitter\u2019s strong position in mobile and trove of frequently-updated celebrity content. But we\u2019ll find out in the next couple of months whether investors buy that story. Facebook was in a much stronger position \u2014 and its IPO didn\u2019t exactly go well.", "lede": "Twitter finally opened the kimono on Thursday, showing the world ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/twitter-pales-next-to-facebook/"}, {"author": "Cade Metz", "title": "As Twitter IPO Looms, Facebook Turns on Instagram Ads", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 22:04:00", "content": "Instagram will soon begin serving ads.

The movie will enter general release here in the US on October 4. It stars George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as two astronauts having what looks to be a really, really bad day in space. Trailers for the movie show them flying around in their space suits, yelling and crying and dodging debris from exploding satellites and space ships and space stations, all lit by a beautifully rendered and untouchably distant Earth in the background. The director and the studio have taken great pains to recreate the experience of operating in microgravity as accurately as possible. Cuar\u00f3n consulted with NASA astronauts on the particulars of moving in microgravity, and,\u00a0 according to the\u00a0 NY Daily News , the movie's production designers studied thousands of NASA photographs in order to make their vision of space look authentic. When asked how far that commitment to verisimilitude stretched, though, Cuar\u00f3n said that while the movie strives for accuracy, \"it would be disingenuous to say we did it 100 percent, because this is a movie, and we needed to take certain liberties.\" The five minute-plus extended trailer for Gravity . Keep this video handy, because we're going to give it the MST3k treatment in just a moment. There was a five-minute \"extended trailer\" for the movie published last month. It certainly had some gripping visuals, but the longer it went on, the deeper my frown became. I don't claim to be an expert, but the stuff that George Clooney and Sandra Bullock were doing on the screen just didn't look right. Certainly cool, but not right. But this is Ars, and on certain things, we have the hook up . I may not be the expert, but I knew someone who was, and I was going to ask for his official opinion on that extended trailer. The man who makes the plan The last time I talked with Zeb Scoville was at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab , the enormous indoor pool where NASA trains its astronauts on how to spacewalk\u2014or, more properly, how to function during extravehicular activity, or EVA. Scoville is the EVA task group lead at the NBL, and he is responsible for managing the teams that figure out how EVAs work. If an EVA's goal is to replace a part outside the space station, for example, Scoville figures out exactly what the astronauts need to do to replace the part, including the physical movements they need to make. His team is made up of actual NASA flight controllers\u2014during training at the pool, they run the simulations, and during the actual missions, they're manning the consoles in Mission Control. Enlarge / NASA EVA Task Group manager Zeb Scoville, standing in one of the test coordinator control rooms at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory . Visible behind him is the NBL pool. Steven Michael If anyone could shed some light on the accuracy or inaccuracy of Clooney and Bullock's space antics, I figured Scoville would be the man. After a quick call to NASA's press office to arrange some time to talk, we sat down together to watch our way through the trailer. Problem: debris The trailer kicks off with an EVA in progress, and a radio-distorted voice is heard calling for an abort. It becomes clear that the message is directed at some astronauts working on something outside their spacecraft. It looks like they're repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, though it might be something else\u2014for instance, some KEYHOLE reconnaissance satellites are said to share the Hubble's external form factor. Whatever it is, the astronauts are outside with big debris incoming, which means they're in trouble. Enlarge / Screencap from the trailer, showing the start of a giant debris storm. Note the monstrous size of the piece of debris near frame center. Warner Bros Right away, the sheer size of the debris gave us pause. NASA relies on US Strategic Command's big radars to keep constant radar watch on its vehicles, and the chunks shown on-screen are far larger than the minimum size that USSTRATCOM would notice. \"Part of the procedure for getting ready for an EVA would include checking for debris like this, wouldn't it?\" I asked. \"Right\u2014we have a process that's known as a 'certification of EVA readiness,'\" answered Scoville. \"We have the EVA community come together, and they'll present a lot of the technical analysis, and we give our community-wide consensus for a 'go' for the EVA.\" Scoville explained that this analysis includes an assessment of the risk of encountering orbital debris during the EVA. Space isn't empty, especially at the International Space Station's low altitude, and there's always the chance that there'll be a \"conjunction,\" NASA-speak for a potential collision between debris and a vehicle or astronaut. Debris risk is assessed in terms of the potential damage\u2014whether the expected amount of debris could cause a suit leak small enough to survive (which would terminate the mission), or whether it could cause loss of a spacecraft or even astronaut lives. \"The debris they have there is orders of magnitude larger than what you need to create a very catastrophic puncture in a space suit. For comparison, if you have up to about an eighth inch of a hole in an EMU\"\u2014that's Extravehicular Mobility Unit, NASA's acronym for a spacesuit\u2014\"it has emergency oxygen systems which can feed that leak and maintain pressure for about 30 minutes to get you back inside the airlock and repress the airlock. Above about an eighth of an inch, and it can't maintain pressure.\" \"Is there a procedure for what to do if that happens?\" I asked. \"Like, you stick your finger in the hole or try to squeeze the leak closed?\" Scoville responded in the negative because of the spacesuit's many-layered structure. \"On the inside, you have the bladder layer, that actually maintains the pressure of the suit. Beyond that there's the restraint layer, and then you have a neoprene layer, and beyond that the insulation mylar layers for heat rejection, with layers of scrim in between for separation, then the white Ortho-Fabric on the outside. No matter how much you squeeze or push on the outer layer, you're not getting to the inner layer where the bladder is. You wouldn't be able to seal that with a gloved hand with 4.3 pounds of pressure trying to get out of the suit.\" Although an EVA wouldn't be allowed to happen under such conditions, Scoville speaks up here and lets me know that he's actually Googled a plot summary of the movie in preparation for our talk. The debris in Gravity \u00a0actually comes from an event that occurs after the EVA has started. Under such circumstances, the EVA would indeed be terminated, just as is depicted in the trailer. I stow my nerd rage, and we continue. Problem: Clooney's jetpack After the debris zips past, intrepid astronaut George \"The Chin\" Clooney comes in frame, sporting a very cool space jetpack. There's a problem with that backpack, though\u2014nothing like it exists in NASA's active inventory anymore. To me, it looks like Clooney's character is supposed to be wearing a Manned Maneuvering Unit or MMU, a piece of equipment developed for shuttle astronauts to use while repairing satellites. The MMUs worked great, but they weren't used very much, and NASA discontinued flying them in the 1990s. They weren't re-introduced for use on the International Space Station because they're too large and bulky. Enlarge / Clooney's fancy faux-MMU backpack sure does zip him around quick. Unfortunately, it's a wholly fictional piece of hardware. Warner Bros. I point this out to Scoville. \"Yeah,\" he replied. \"It looks not quite like a MMU, but it's something close to it. Those things, the manned maneuvering units, are no longer used. In some of those shots, it looks like a cross between a MMU and a thing we call SAFER , which stands for 'Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue,' which is similar to a MMU\u2014except it doesn't have the same level of redundancy, it's not as large, the joystick is a little different, and it doesn't hold as much gas.\" Enlarge / The SAFER backpack\u2014the closest operational real-world analog to the thing Clooney is wearing. The SAFER backpacks are for astronauts working around the International Space Station, and as the acronym suggests, they're intended to be used in case an astronaut accidentally drifts away from the station. Scoville explains that the little safety jetpack has 24 thrusters powered by the venting of compressed nitrogen gas, and it can accelerate an astronaut up to about 10 feet per second. The SAFER also has a smart gyro-based stabilization system that will automatically stop an astronaut from tumbling. However, these packs aren't intended to be used as the primary means for flitting about outside. The limited amount of delta-v the backpacks can impart is more than enough to stop a drifting astronaut, but the amount of propellant is very limited. SAFER backpacks weren't used on shuttle missions, either: \"On shuttle missions, when they weren't docked to station, they didn't need this\u2014they could just fly the shuttle after them to pick them up if they fell off.\" This provides one explanation for why Clooney's character is wearing a jetpack and Bullock's character isn't\u2014when we meet her in a moment, she's strapped into the foot restraints at the end of the space shuttle's remote manipulator arm, busily working away at repairing the telescope.

Just Go See Gravity</em>", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:30:00", "content": "During a particularly eye-popping scene in the astonishing new space thriller\u00a0 Gravity , I thought I saw my boyfriend, who was sitting next to me in the theater, yawn. For that fraction of a second, I questioned everything I knew about him, our relationship, and most damningly, his taste in movies. When I turned to look, however, I realized that his jaw was simply hanging open. It\u2019s a far more appropriate response to one of the most astonishing cinematic spectacles ever created. \u201cHow in the hell did they do that?\u201d we wondered, walking out of the theater later. This is the sort of movie that inspires those kinds of conversations, that kind of awe. And if you\u2019re the sort of movie viewer who would rather walk into an extremely memorable movie experience completely cold, then do yourself a favor: Stop reading now, buy a ticket to see the movie this weekend in 3-D (IMAX preferred), and get ready to have your mind blown. Minor spoilers for Gravity follow. The movie is a sort of minimalist mobile, hung over the crib of the Earth, with only three things dangling from it: astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer on her first mission in space; Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), a veteran rocket jockey; and \u2026 some other guy. (Technically his name is Shariff, but let\u2019s just say that he gets plucked off the mobile a little bit too early for it to really matter.) After a deadly debris field \u2014 damn those Russians! \u2014 catastrophically damages the satellite and cuts off all communication between the astronauts and Earth, we\u2019re left with two actors in a one-room play, albeit a room the size of the universe. The story is as small and personal as the setting is vast, and the movie\u2019s sense of space somehow captures those contradictions of scale: the agoraphobia of darkness extending infinitely in every direction, and the claustrophobia of being sealed inside tiny suits and shuttles that are the only insulation from instant death. Space, as the opening sequence of the movie reminds us, is a place where the temperature can vacillate between -260 to 150 degrees, where there is no oxygen, where there is no sound. In short, \u201clife is impossible.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment shared on multiple levels by Dr. Stone, a quiet, withdrawn woman who is difficult to love at the beginning of the movie, particularly compared to the jocular, talkative Kowalski, who jets around her like a kid on a zero-G rope swing, telling off-color stories about ex-wives and playing country music. It\u2019s not long before we learn the reason for her stoicism: She lost a daughter in a terrifyingly mundane accident \u2014 falling down on the playground \u2014 and has never quite recovered from it. Stone mentions there\u2019s no one who would mourn her if she didn\u2019t come back, and we get the sense that she detached from the world long before she started floating above it. It\u2019s hard to imagine a better metaphor for depression, or for grief: untethered and abandoned in a void so large that it boggles the mind , or simply shuts it down.\u00a0 You can tell, at times, that the idea of drifting away seems tempting to Stone, as if she could simply fall asleep in the infinite, inky snowbank of space. Much of the film is Stone\u2019s struggle, both literally and figuratively, between when to hold on to things and when to let them go. For her part,\u00a0Bullock acts the hell out of it, carrying almost the entire film on her shoulders in a transformative performance that seems destined for award nominations. The characters spend a lot of time talking to themselves \u2014 and to each other \u2014 to literally\u00a0fill the space, the way you turn on the TV in an empty house to feel like you\u2019re not alone. If there\u2019s any weakness in the film, it\u2019s the on-the-nose dialogue that sometimes emerges from these monologues, which end up simply telling us what the film has already shown us. Still, this thematic rib-poking doesn\u2019t meaningfully detract from either the film\u2019s emotional impact or its staggering visual grandeur. If ever there were a movie to see in 3-D, this is it. Where other 3-D films delight in shoving objects unexpectedly towards the viewer, here it\u2019s far more powerful to see them falling away. With no gravity to anchor them, every character is just one firm shove away from hurtling into space forever, with nothing to slow them down. There\u2019s a devastating long shot where something essential drifts away from Dr. Stone, receding from an image that fills the screen to a tiny speck. And in 3-D you feel every inch of the distance, growing slowly along with the sickening realization that it has been lost forever. The zero-G environment is remarkable, and the way characters move through it feels alternately weightless and heavy, like moving through liquid; we see the lithe Bullock glide through the portals of a space station with the grace of a swimmer, while outside in space cables and cords splay out as languid as seaweed before snapping back like whips. There\u2019s a breath and pulse to all of it, a rhythm that feels cyclical. Even the debris field \u2014 the primary antagonist, aside from the deadliness of space \u2014 has its own deadly orbit, reappearing to terrorize our heroes every 90 minutes as it hurtles its way around the earth. Be warned: For all its dazzling cinematography, this is a tense, anxious thriller; once it begins, there\u2019s little relief until the credits start rolling. If you have dreams later about Gravity , chances are they\u2019ll be nightmares about fumbling, endlessly and fruitlessly for handholds on spacecraft that you can never quite grasp before you tumble into nothingness. But rarely has that nightmare been so gorgeous to behold, or so unexpectedly life-affirming. I left the theater feeling like I\u2019d witnessed something so incredible that I wanted to tug on the sleeve of the person next to me and say, \u201cDid you see that?!\u201d If you\u2019d like to have an answer to that question when everyone is talking about Gravity come Monday, then I say to you again: Go buy a ticket. There are many things to say about this film, but the tl;dr version is this is a movie that demands to be beheld.

There\u2019s\u00a0 halted food safety inspections , kids with cancer who\u00a0 won\u2019t be able to join \u00a0clinical drug trials, and\u00a0 suspension of disease outbreak monitoring . Conservation studies have been thrown into disarray \u00a0and at least one NASA Mars mission is at risk of being delayed for years. But one area where the devastating effects aren\u2019t getting much public attention is basic biomedical research. What\u2019s happening to the thousands of researchers and billions of dollars dedicated to understanding human disease and development? I talked to a government biomedical scientist about the shutdown\u2019s effect. Because the scientist was instructed not to speak with the media, this person will remain anonymous. Below is an edited version of what the scientist told me. I\u2019m sitting here, the only person in the whole wing of this building, alone. The lights are off in my office. It\u2019s very depressing. It\u2019s very sad. I don\u2019t think the public realizes the devastating impact that this has on scientific research. Scientific research is not like turning on and off an assembly line. Experiments are frequently long-term and complicated. They involve specific treatments and specific times. You can\u2019t just stop and restart it. You\u2019ve probably just destroyed the experiment. You also can\u2019t necessarily recover. You can\u2019t begin an experiment all over again. If you do, you\u2019ll be set back months \u2014 if there\u2019s even time and personnel to do it. But often, science moves rapidly, times change, and you can\u2019t re-initiate the experiments. It\u2019s an enormous loss to scientific research, an enormous loss of time and personnel. Scientists are hardworking people. They work long hours, on weekends, and they do that because it\u2019s necessary. The schedules they follow aren\u2019t like an industrial plant\u2019s. If you interrupt them, they can\u2019t pick up and start again. It\u2019s an enormous waste of money and resources to interrupt this and have it abandoned. Unlike most other government medical researchers, this scientist has been allowed to visit the laboratory to feed rodents used in research by the scientist\u2019s group. Many if not most of the rodents will soon be euthanized. It\u2019s not a matter of feeding the animals and cleaning their cages. These animals used for research are used in intricate experiments, involving treatments and collection of data performed by hundreds of individual scientists with each project. An animal caretaker can\u2019t continue that. Given that, you can imagine what has to happen. You cannot maintain colonies for no reason. It\u2019s very expensive \u2014 and if they\u2019re useless for research, what are you going to do? And mice and rats breed like crazy. An exponential expansion of the population that will rapidly fill all the cages. Every lab I know already works to maximum capacity. You can\u2019t leave animals for somebody to feed and water. So every time a shutdown happens, measures have to be taken. The politicians might talk gloatingly about how they averted a shutdown five minutes to midnight, like the last one \u2014 but that\u2019s too late. The damage has already been done. All our preparations have to be done well in advance. As soon as you find out there\u2019s only going to be caretakers for the animals, the experiments have to end. We do our experiments 24/7 in my lab. You have to harvest at particular times. Experiments need to be processed and manipulated. A week\u2019s interruption would mean wasting and interrupting a lot of material \u2014 but what we\u2019re given is a shutdown of an indefinite period. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. We try to maintain as much life and resources as possible, but there\u2019s a lot that can\u2019t be maintained given an indefinite shutdown. While talking about the imminent death of the animals, remorse enters the scientist\u2019s voice. I\u2019m surprised: After all, the rodents are going to be killed during the experiments anyways, right? We only take the life of an animal if it\u2019s justified to provide new insight that will lead to basic understandings in science, or new treatments in human disease. We understand and appreciate that. We don\u2019t do it lightly. We do it deliberately. There\u2019s a difference between using an animal to obtain knowledge of human disease, and just having to engage in a mercy killing for no outcome, and with an enormous loss to science and to resources. It\u2019s a waste of money, a waste of time, a waste of people, a waste of animals. I ask if the scientist is being paid. I\u2019m not being paid. They\u2019ve promised to compensate me when this ends. Here I am in a dark building. I walk by the snack shop that this family runs, that everybody here in the building uses. They\u2019re an immigrant family, hardworking, they take the bus to work. They\u2019re here before anybody else and leave at the end of the day. Now that door is closed. That family is getting no money. They\u2019re not going to recover it. They\u2019re not going to be paid for the lost income. These are hardworking people that need the money. And it\u2019s all lost because of politicians engaging in this political terrorism. Democracy means that you\u2019re not always going to get your way. That\u2019s what democracy is.

There was no formal organization, no employees, no detailed science plan. Emboldened by advances in remote sensing, data storage and computing power, NEON sought answers to the biggest question in ecology: How do global climate change, land use and biodiversity influence natural and managed ecosystems and the biosphere as a whole? \u201cWe don\u2019t understand that very well,\u201d Schimel said. Splitting his time at first between the new project and his role as a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , Schimel said he was surprised by the magnitude of the challenge, by the \u201csheer number of different measurements required to address the key science questions.\u201d Before any observatories could be erected or staff members hired, decisions had to be made about where to take measurements, what to measure, how to measure it and how to generate meaningful data. Schimel began to explore site options across the country and to assemble NASA-inspired \u201ctiger teams\u201d that could develop rigorous scientific methodologies and data-processing requirements. The final plan called for hiring dozens of scientists with disparate backgrounds; building more than 100 data-collection sites across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico; recording approximately 600 billion raw measurements per year for 30 years; and converting the raw data into more user-friendly \u201cdata products\u201d to be made freely available to scientists and the public. Building the observatory network is projected to take four more years and cost $434 million, and millions more will be needed to cover annual operating expenses. In 2007, Schimel became NEON\u2019s chief scientist and first full-time employee. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in processes at the continental scale for a long time and it\u2019s always been a data-starved activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opportunity to actually design a system to collect the right data at that scale was irresistible.\u201d Across the sciences, similar analyses of large-scale observational or experimental data, dubbed \u201cbig science,\u201d offer insights into many of the greatest mysteries. What is dark matter , and how is it distributed throughout the universe? Does life exist, or is it capable of existing on another planet? What are the connections between genetic markers and disease? How will the Earth\u2019s climate change over the next century and beyond? How do neural networks form thoughts, memories and consciousness? Much of the recent data frenzy \u2014 from the physical and life sciences to the user-generated content aggregated by Google, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 has come in the form of largely unstructured streams of digital potpourri that require new, flexible databases, massive computing power and sophisticated algorithms to wring out bits of meaning from them, said Matt LeMay, a former product manager at the URL shortening and bookmarking service Bitly. But \u201cbig data is not magic,\u201d he cautioned while teaching a database workshop this summer in Lower Manhattan. It doesn\u2019t matter how much data you have if you can\u2019t make sense of it. For projects like NEON, interpreting the data is a complicated business. Early on, the team realized that its data, while mid-size compared with the largest physics and biology projects, would be big in complexity. \u201cNEON\u2019s contribution to big data is not in its volume,\u201d said Steve Berukoff , the project\u2019s assistant director for data products. \u201cIt\u2019s in the heterogeneity and spatial and temporal distribution of data.\u201d Unlike the roughly 20 critical measurements in climate science or the vast but relatively structured data in particle physics, NEON will have more than 500 quantities to keep track of, from temperature, soil and water measurements to insect, bird, mammal and microbial samples to remote sensing and aerial imaging. Much of the data is highly unstructured and difficult to parse \u2014 for example, taxonomic names and behavioral observations, which are sometimes subject to debate and revision. And, as daunting as the looming data crush appears from a technical perspective, some of the greatest challenges are wholly nontechnical. Many researchers say the big science projects and analytical tools of the future can succeed only with the right mix of science, statistics, computer science, pure mathematics and deft leadership. In the big data age of distributed computing \u2014 in which enormously complex tasks are divided across a network of computers \u2014 the question remains: How should distributed science be conducted across a network of researchers? \u201cMachines are not going to organize data science research,\u201d said Bin Yu , a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, who works on high-dimensional data problems. \u201cHumans have to lead the way.\u201d But, she said, \u201cno one knows who is leading data science right now.\u201d Describing universities as \u201cvery siloed,\u201d Yu said the goal is not merely interdisciplinary research, but rather to reach a state of \u201ctransdisciplinary research,\u201d without walls or divisions. Big science projects \u201ccan\u2019t be dealt with by one person,\u201d said Jack Gilbert , an environmental microbiologist at Argonne National Laboratory who has helped NEON develop standards for analyzing soil samples and plans to utilize its data when it comes online. \u201cWe need to work together. It\u2019s too big a problem.\u201d Big \u2018Bad\u2019 Science Ecology has traditionally involved small, localized studies that examine how organisms interact with their surroundings. But in grappling with the foundational questions on a regional or global scale, the microsystems approach brings to mind the old Indian parable in which six blind men feel different parts of an elephant to determine its shape. In John Godfrey Saxe\u2019s popular retelling, the men come to wildly divergent conclusions, that the elephant is like a wall, spear, snake, tree, fan or rope. \u201cWe were missing key pieces of information and not getting the big picture,\u201d said Andrea Thorpe , 37, a plant ecologist who pursued smaller-scale studies on invasive species before joining NEON last year as its assistant director for terrestrial ecology. Although smaller studies provide much-needed depth and detail at a local level, they also tend to be limited to a specific set of questions and reflect an investigator\u2019s particular methodology, which can make results more difficult to reproduce or reconcile with broader models. \u2018There are some really big impacts happening to the ecosystem that can\u2019t be studied with short-term, smaller studies.\u2019 \u201cYou can\u2019t escape the fact that there are some really big impacts happening to the ecosystem that can\u2019t be studied with short-term, smaller studies,\u201d Thorpe said. Macrosystems, or \u201cbig,\u201d ecology, as Schimel calls it, becomes possible with standardized, broad-scale data. He says that having large, rich data sets enables scientists to incorporate the complexity and variability of the real world into their models of large-scale phenomena, rather than to \u201cpeanut butter over\u201d them with simplified models. Ecologists first delved into the world of big data about 50 years ago with the International Biological Program, which cut across scientific disciplines and involved dozens of countries in an attempt to model large-scale systems. It is beloved by the pioneers and supporters of international partnerships but was roundly criticized at the time by traditional biologists who were skeptical of big data modeling and titanic collaborations. Although the project paved the way for newer collaborative efforts like NEON, some of the criticisms have lingered. In 1969, Thomas Rosswall joined the Swedish tundra biome section of the IBP as a 28-year-old microbial ecologist. At a time when little coordinated research existed in biology, he said, the challenge was to get the microbiologists to work with the botanists and the hydrologists to work with the meteorologists. And the Cold War meant that outside scientists couldn\u2019t visit the Russian sites. Instead, the Russians shared pictures of their work. Rosswall, a former executive director of the International Council for Science who is now retired, said his IBP work shaped his career as an international scientist. The tundra project was a particularly close-knit community, he said. \u201cWe were also young and rather na\u00efve, and maybe that was good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have preconceived ideas on how things should be done.\u201d Pages: 1 2 View All", "lede": "Seven years ago, when David Schimel was asked to design an ambiti...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/10/big-data-science/"}]}, {"cluster": 5, "articles": [{"author": "Alex Williams", "title": "Cotap Launches Mobile Messaging Service For The Business World", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 05:20:41", "content": "Cotap Launches Mobile Messaging Service For The Business\u00a0World Cotap , a startup that\u00a0strives\u00a0to be the GroupMe of the business world, has launched its mobile\u00a0 messaging service designed for corporate customers. The service, available as an iPhone app and later on Android, allows users to invite people into managed, group conversations. It is similar to\u00a0GroupMe, the mobile messaging service that has become popular for texting with groups of people. With Cotap, a\u00a0customer invites one or more people who exchange messages via SMS or by email if they do not have an account. When joining the Cotap service, co-workers are added to a shared company\u00a0address\u00a0book so people can communicate\u00a0without\u00a0having to make \u201cfriends\u201d with other co-workers. Founded by Jim Patterson, Yammer\u2019s former chief product officer, the service\u00a0 employs a similar model to the enterprise social network that sold to\u00a0 Microsoft \u00a0for $1.2 billion. Cotap is free but requires a contract if the company wants to adopt the platform. The model obviously worked for Yammer, but it was confrontational. Yammer made it an all-or-nothing proposition: Pay up for control over the service or don\u2019t, and employees will continue to get access to the service with permission or not. Cotap wants to take a more conciliatory\u00a0approach to help IT see the value in the service. Patterson said its premium\u00a0features will include data export, data retention and monitoring. If a company doesn\u2019t buy, its users can continue to use the basic service for free, which is the same model as Yammer and Box. Patterson said Cotap will focus\u00a0more on selling value to companies rather than ownership of the data. \u201cLong term, we don\u2019t see\u00a0Cotap\u00a0as an IT tool, so our primary premium features won\u2019t be IT tools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the long-term value of\u00a0Cotap\u00a0being around employee engagement, which is the priority of C-level execs or HR.\u201d Launch Date: May 2013 Funding: $5.5M CoTap\u2019s mission is to help people work together better by simplifying mobile communication in the workplace.

Image: Dillenburger Architects Michael Hansmeyer and Benjamin Dillenburger are passionate about pushing the limits of 3-D design, and their latest algorithmically generated project, a room called Digital Grotesque , is composed of 260 million surfaces and 30 billion voxels, and takes up 78 gigabytes of hard drive space. Just rendering images of the stunningly detailed, 170-square-foot space took weeks, and when they searched for a 3-D printer that could produce their cavernous creation, none of the popular plastic printers could handle the load. CAD files in hand, the designer duo set out in search of a machine that could accommodate their architectural ambitions and found a solution in a 3-D printer typically used to manufacture engine blocks. Larger than most cars, Voxeljet\u2019s 3-D printers build models using silica sand and are capable of producing sandy sculptures that weigh up to 12 tons while maintaining a barely perceivable 0.13 millimeter layer thickness. These machines usually fabricate sand molds for investment casting. Their output is seen as a disposable byproduct, but Hansmeyer and Dillenburger coated the gritty components with a strengthening resin and treated them like giant sandstone bricks. \u201cThe limiting factor for us was no longer the dimensions of the printable space,\u201d says Hansmeyer, \u201cbut the logistics of transporting and assembling the pieces.\u201d It is an architecture that would otherwise be undrawable, and even inconceivable. It took a year for the designers to find the right tools and fabricating the building blocks took over a month, but the massive, 9-foot tall, industrial-strength sand castle was assembled in just under a day with the help of a gantry crane and team of volunteers. The physical results are stunning, but for Hansmeyer the design process is equally impressive and was an attempt to visualize the answer to a simple question: \u201cHow could an architecture that is entirely designed by algorithms look?\u201d Digital Grotesque looks like something that could have sprung from Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s drawing board, but the swirling, baroque shapes of the room are actually the results of a few simple equations, and Hansmeyer believes they \u201ccreate an architecture that would otherwise be undrawable, or even inconceivable using traditional means.\u201d Despite its procedural pedigree, Hansmeyer still claims authorship over the design. \u201cThe architect is still very much the designer, not the computer,\u201d he says, but the computational approach does change the creator\u2019s role. Software allows for dozens of potential solutions to emerge which can then be fed back into the system to create more potential designs, but leaves the real skill is in editing the results. \u201cThe architect becomes the cultivator and moderator of these production processes and forfeits direct control of some attributes to gain control over others.\u201d Digital Grotesque is an amazing proof of concept, but Hansmeyer has only laid the cornerstone of what could ultimately be a cathedral built to the glory of computational design. \u201cOne of the most astonishing things, and something we\u2019re still trying to get our head around, is that it costs the exact same amount to 3-D print a plain box as it does to print the most elaborate form conceivable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe costs are the same, and the amount of time required is the same. It is only the outside dimensions that matter, so there is no longer any cost for complexity and no cost for ornament.\u201d Digital Grosteque pushed the limits of laptops and 3-D printer, but the pair of architects have big plans to 3-D print a house with details as fine as grains of sand. \u201cIt will be a house that looks like nothing we can imagine today, and is just within reach!\u201d says Hansmeyer.", "lede": "Dramatic lighting helps catch the 170-square-foot structure's ext...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/design/2013/10/designers-build-industrial-strength-sand-castle-with-3-d-printer/"}]}, {"cluster": 6, "articles": [{"author": "Mark Gurman", "title": "Best Buy giving out $50 gift cards with iPhone 5c purchases through Oct. 7", "feed_title": "9to5Mac", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:45:36", "content": "Best Buy has noted on its website that between today (Thursday) and October 7th (next Monday), it will be offering $50 gift cards with iPhone 5c purchases.

London-based designers Shay Alkalay and Yael Mer run a studio together and are also the proud parents of a restless child who frequently demands bonus bedtime stories in the wee hours of the morning. One sleep deprived night, Mer was balancing his baby, holding a copy of Goodnight Moon , and using his iPhone as a flashlight when he got a bright idea\u2014turn the smartphone into a lightbulb and ensconce it in a little lamp to free up a hand and streamline story time. \u201cIt was a survival situation,\u201d jokes Mer. \u201cThe phone was next to me, I didn\u2019t have a bedside light, and it was hard to hold three things at once.\u201d Mer and Alkalay quickly started sketching up ideas for bedside lamps that would use smartphones as $600 LED lightbulbs. A list of requirements took shape quickly. They wanted a product that could accommodate many kinds of smartphones, a design with no electronics so their creation wouldn\u2019t become obsolete if a company switched up the connector, no specialized apps would be required, and most importantly, it needed to feel like furniture, not a gadget.

Photo booths are charming, sure. But they\u2019re also uncomfortable, archaic in their technology and half the time don\u2019t even print your photos. The Thermobooth, on the other hand, is a super smart version of photo booths past. With its geometrical, post-modern look, not only is it a beautiful object, it\u2019s also fail-proof. To make the Thermobooth work, all you need to do is touch the person next to you, and an electric charge triggers the flash, camera and printer. When two people touch skin to skin, the electrical circuit is closed. Designed by Talia Radford of Vienna-based taliaYstudio and artist Jonas Bohatsch , the Thermobooth replaces old photo booth technology with high-tech OLED lights, conductive plates and a thermal printer. The idea originated when Radford was looking for a way to make one of her studio parties more interactive. She called up Bohatsch, who has been working in the media art space for a while, and they hatched up a plan to create a 21st century photo booth. The original set up used at Radford\u2019s party was pretty rudimentary\u2014it was basically just a computer camera with a flash hanging off of it that was connected to a MaKey MaKey and thermal printer. \u201cIt was really ugly\u201d she recalls. But the concept was interesting. Interesting enough for lighting manufacturer OSRAM to help Radford and Bohatsch develop an upgraded version that uses OLED lights, the fancy new lighting technology used in expensive televisions. Radford\u2019s most recent design is more like a photo studio, with an open stage that\u2019s obscured by simple geometric mirrors rising from what Radford describes as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the set-up. These mirrors are actually OLED lights that act as both the flash and a way for users to check their mugs before the camera snaps. When you walk into the Thermobooth (shoes free) you step onto a carpet that has two circular plates. These discs are connected to the booth\u2019s brain through a MaKey MaKey and act as a break in the electrical circuit. So when two people touch skin to skin, the electrical circuit is closed, effectively turning participants into human-sized switch that powers the flash, camera and printer. It\u2019s a clever application of technology, plus it\u2019s a good excuse to take an adorable picture. The photo you get isn\u2019t the highest quality, but the choice to use a thermal printer instead of the glossy, high-tech variety was a deliberate choice. The Thermobooth, Radford says, is\u00a0about impulsiveness\u2014grabbing someone and kissing them, hugging them or even picking their nose (yes, that has happened). \u201cThe quality of the photos it\u2019s not really that great, but then we realized it\u2019s not really about the quality of the photos,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most important thing isn\u2019t the image, but what the image evokes.\u201d", "lede": "The Thermobooth only takes a photo when two people touch.

One of these things is not like the others. Andrew Cunningham Following numerous complaints about the issue on Apple's support forums, Gizmodo\u00a0 looked into reports that the motion sensors on the new iPhone 5S are not calibrated properly. By comparing the iPhone 5S to an iPhone 5 and also to several real-world tools that the phone replicates with motion sensors (including an actual compass and a spirit level), Gizmodo found that the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer in two separate iPhone 5Ses do indeed appear to be off by a small but consistently measurable amount. We confirmed Gizmodo's findings when we compared our own iPhone 5S to an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 4S, all running iOS 7.0.2\u2014as you can see by the picture above, the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 resting on our desk recognize that they're resting on a flat surface while the iPhone 5S does not. We re-calibrated the Compass app several times and consistently got the same results. The severity of the problem appears to vary from phone to phone\u2014some posters in a MacRumors forum thread on the topic claim that their phones are off by four or six degrees (instead of two, as with our iPhone 5S and with Gizmodo's), while others report that they no longer had the issue after getting a replacement phone from Apple. The relatively wide range of inaccuracies being reported and the fact that the iPhone 5 and 4S aren't affected point to this being a hardware issue and not a software issue, though without a statement for Apple it's difficult to say for sure. Beyond the inaccuracies in the compass app, the actual real-world impact of this issue is small. While Gizmodo's videos do show that the sensors can cause problems for games if you have the phone resting flat on a table, most people are going to subconsciously adjust the phone to compensate for the slight inaccuracies.

We\u2019ve been receiving several complaints from iPhone users about inaccurate readings from the gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, and other sensor-based features for the device, and today Gizmodo found similar issues with a 5s unit that it tested: We\u2019ve confirmed the new iPhone\u2019s failings on our own.

In most cases, we used the iPhone\u2019s built-in iOS 7 apps for measurements, working under the assumption that Apple would properly calibrate its hardware to work with the software of its own design. We were wrong. Gizmodo tested the iPhone\u2019s level, gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer and found that the 5s is off compared to the same tests on an iPhone 5 and 4S. For example, it discovered its 5s unit\u2019s level was reading 2-3 degrees off the 5 and 4S, which also proved to be troublesome for games that rely on the gyroscope, like driving games, for motion controls: The same issue was the case with the compass, measuring around 8-10 degrees different than the iPhone 5, as well as the accelerometer, which Gizmodo says \u201cis registering way more latent motion.\u201d Since all devices tested by Gizmodo and others were running iOS 7, all signs point to a hardware issue with the 5s, but it\u2019s still possible software optimizations could fix how the 5s records data from its sensors.

A couple years ago, Federici was working on his Ph.D. in biological sciences at Cambridge University studying self-organization, the process by which things organize themselves spontaneously and without direction. Like a flock of birds flying together . More specifically, he was using microscopes and a process called fluorescence microscopy to see if he could identify these kinds of patterns on a cellular level. In fluorescence microscopy, scientists shine a particular kind of light at whatever they\u2019re trying to illuminate and then that substance identifies itself by shining a different color or light back. Sometimes researchers will also attach proteins that they know emit a particular kind of light to substances as a kind of identifier. In the non-microscopic world, it\u2019s like using a black light on a stoner poster. Federici grew up with photography as a hobby, so looking through the microscope at all the different colors and patterns he realized that the process was highly visual. He hadn\u2019t seen many images like what he was seeing published for the general public, so he asked for permission from his adviser Jim Haseloff to post the photos on his Flickr site . Today that site is filled with pages and pages of microscopic images, some of which are from his work, while others are just for fun. \u201cMicroscopy is always serious science,\u201d says Federici, who is now a researcher at Pontificia Univerisdad Catolica de Chile. \u201cFor us [in the department at Cambridge] this was something we looked at as outreach. It was a way to bring this scientific data to the general public.\u201d Many of the photos on the site show particular bacteria colonies that were studied for their self-organizing principles. Others are just images of old plants that were used to teach botany at the university over a hundred years ago. Before fluorescence microscopy, scientists used dyes to try and single out certain cells or structures. Those dyes, which sat for decades on the plants, now make for arty images under a microscope. Other photos on the Flickr page include microscopic images of crystals and oil. Federici says there\u2019s still a lot to learn about self-organization so viewers can look forward to more art from him. If or when his colleagues are successful at what they\u2019re chasing in self-organization, they eventually hope to be able to control it through something called synthetic biology, which will be a game-changer. \u201cWe can imagine a future of intelligent material,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, instead of chopping a tree down to make a chair, scientists might eventually be able to control a tree to just grow a chair.\u201d", "lede": "Fernan Federici\u2019s microscopic images of plants, bacteria, and cry...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2013/10/beautiful-microscopic-art-is-also-world-changing-science/"}, {"author": "Jordan Teicher", "title": "This 98-Year-Old Man Spent 13 Years Creating Remarkable Art in MS Paint", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:49:00", "content": "Hal Lasko may be 98 years old, but while many of his peers devote their leisure time to shuffleboard and bridge, he has a very different passion: creating huge works of art pixel by pixel in Microsoft Paint. While most people have long since abandoned MS Paint as an outdated graphics application, Lasko has spent the last 13 years using the program to digitally create works of art, spending up to 10 hours a day on his work. Originally a traditional painter, he switched to MS Paint in 2005 when his vision was impaired by wet macular degeneration, an eye disease that causes blindness in the center of his vision. He has since created more than 150 digital works, though his blindness means he will never be able to view them in their totality. \u201cWhen I started to go blind, I wasn\u2019t able to get the brush quite where I wanted it,\u201d Lasko told WIRED. \u201cSo when I got into the art program on the computer, I appreciated that I could blow it up eight hundred times [larger] and be sure that I was hitting the right spot.\u201d Although he had never used computer graphics software before, Lasko did have experience with artistic design after working as a typographer. He mastered lettering as an apprentice after high school, creating fonts by hand, and learned to paint traditionally on his own. His grandson, Ryan Lasko, initially introduced him to Microsoft Paint, but according to Ryan, that too \u201cis all pretty much self-taught.\u201d Hal\u2019s work has been inspired by artists including Edward Hopper, Charles Burchfield, and Paul Clay; lately, he has come to appreciate impressionism, and experimented with ways to adapt its thin, layered brushstrokes with an 8-bit twist. While he initially didn\u2019t realize that his digital paintings could be printed, he now has a website selling 16\u201d x 20\u201d prints of eight different works; he may soon begin printing on canvas as well. Last July, Ryan, who works as a graphic designer for a New York City software company, teamed with Josh Bogdan, a college friend and San Francisco copywriter, to direct a short documentary called about Hal and his art. The Pixel Painter (above), which runs eight and a half minutes, spends an entire weekend with Hal discussing his love of making art in MS Paint; the shoot included his 97th birthday celebration and the debut of an art exhibit at a senior center where Hal displayed two of his digital paintings. \u201cHe\u2019ll talk to anyone for hours about his artwork,\u201d Bogdan said. \u201cIt\u2019s his passion.

Since the video was posted on Vimeo last month, it has since tallied 1.2 million plays, reaching viewers in Poland, China, and South Korea. \u201cI was trying to explain things like Facebook and social media to him, but he still can\u2019t really believe it,\u201d Ryan Lasko said. \u201cThis worldwide scope is something he\u2019s still trying to wrap his head around.\u201d", "lede": "Hal Lasko may be 98 years old, but while many of his peers devote...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/pixel-painter-ms-paint/"}]}, {"cluster": 10, "articles": [{"author": "Jason Inofuentes", "title": "Intel powers an Arduino for the first time with new \u201cGalileo\u201d board", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 15:02:22", "content": "Intel At IDF last month, Intel previewed its latest small chip initiative, Quark. Slotting in well below the Atom line, much less Haswell, Quark is aimed at that old chestnut, \"the Internet of things.\" We were curious about when we'd see the first consumer Quark device, and it seems the time is now. At Maker Faire Rome today, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich introduced a collaboration between open source bastion Arduino and Intel's New Devices Group, and the first fruits of that collaboration are Galileo \u00a0(PDF). Typically driven by simple microcontrollers, basic Arduino boards are usually quite limited in connectivity, mainly USB and some Arduino-specific connectors. Expansion comes through those connectors, which allow daughterboards, called shields, to be layered atop the main board, adding additional I/O options. The ease of use\u2014and ease of expansion\u2014has long made the Arduino a favorite among the do-it-yourself crowd for things as simple as Christmas tree lights or as complex as a homebrewing robot. The Intel Galileo reference board isn't a basic board. The Quark SoC is quite potent for a device of this type, resembling a Pentium 3 more than a microcontroller. Though the legacy Arduino connectors remain for compatibility with shields, Galileo features connectivity through USB (host and client), 100Mbps Ethernet, microSD, RS-232, and a full-size mini-PCI Express slot. \"Intel Galileo features the Intel Quark SoC X1000, the first product from the Intel Quark technology family of low-power, small-core products,\" the company said. \"Intel Quark technology will extend Intel architecture into rapidly growing areas\u2014from the Internet of Things to wearable computing in the future.\" Intel will be donating 50,000 Galileo boards to universities around the world as part of the collaboration, and it will be available to hobbyists for $60 or less by November 29. That price makes Galileo quite competitive with existing Arduino boards, most of which aren't as feature complete. Intel promises full compatibility with Arduino software and existing hardware, which could make this a very attractive board for complex projects. Today's announcement continues Intel's attempts to target the DIY market dominated by Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, and Arduino. Intel recently teamed up with the maker of the BeagleBoard to create the \" Minnowboard ,\" a $199 computer powered by open hardware and software. Tiny computers have been run in large part by Intel's rival ARM lately. That's true of the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone Black . While Arduino traditionally used microcontrollers such as Atmel's, Arduino unveiled its first ARM-powered board one year ago with the Arduino DUE.

Flutter is a simple Windows and Mac OSX app that lets you control popular media players through a webcam. Just put your hand up to stop the media playback, or point your thumb right for \"next\" and left for \"previous.\" It seems that few people had heard of Flutter (yours truly included) until Google took the company under its wing, but luckily the app is still available for download, so we snagged it and gave it a quick test. The app works fantastically well, and hand gesture detection is near-instant. It works with iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, VLC, Keynote, Winamp, Windows Media Player, and, with a Chrome extension,\u00a0Youtube, Netflix, Pandora, and Grooveshark. Considering the length of that compatibility list, we suspect it's converting your hand signals into the standard media controls that adorn many keyboards. The homepage of the Flutter website has been replaced with the buyout message, but the original page is still up at\u00a0 https://flutterapp.com/home/ . Navneet Dalal, Flutter's CEO, wrote to the company's users today: When we started three years ago, our dream to build a ubiquitous and power-efficient gesture recognition technology was considered by many as just \"a dream,\" not a real possibility. Since then, we have strived to build the best machine vision algorithms and a delightful user experience. Even after we launched our first app, we didn\u2019t stop our research; your enthusiasm and support pushed us to continue to do better. We're inspired every day when we hear, for example, that Flutter makes you feel like a superhero\u2014because any sufficiently advanced technology should be indistinguishable from magic, right? Today, we are thrilled to announce that we will be continuing our research at Google. We share Google\u2019s passion for 10x thinking, and we\u2019re excited to add their rocket fuel to our journey. We\u2019d like to extend a special thank you to all of our users; your feedback and evangelism inspire us every day. Flutter users will be able to continue to use the app, and stay tuned for future updates. The next question is, what will Google do with a webcam gesture app? The most obvious choice is that it will integrate the functionality into Chromebooks\u00a0or Chrome itself. Flutter's hand gesture recognition could be a big differentiator and would keep the company a step ahead of the OEMs that are working to integrate Leap Motion's more\u00a0 frustrating hand gesture \u00a0technology. With zero extra hardware required, it's much cheaper than Leap technology, too. Using Flutter's capabilities in Android could be another path for Google. Currently, Samsung has a similar feature in its smartphones called \"Air Gesture,\" which lets you accept calls, switch music tracks, flip through pictures, and turn the screen on, all through gestures performed in front of the front-facing camera.

Flies were buzzing around the bloodied patch of earth outside a ransacked mosque in Tha Phyu Chai village where police removed Khin Naing's body after he was hacked to death by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists. \"He couldn't run fast enough from the Rakhine people,\" said his son, Tun Tun Naing, 17, who emerged from hiding to identify his father's corpse from what remained of his charred clothing. Khin Naing was one of five Muslims killed and four Rakhine Buddhists wounded in four days of violence in Thandwe, a township in western Rakhine State popular with foreign tourists for its nearby Ngapali Beach. Not far from its resorts, Buddhists armed with sticks, slingshots and machetes launched repeated attacks on Muslim villagers from Sunday, burning down dozens of homes, witnesses said. Sectarian violence in Myanmar has killed at least 240 people and displaced 140,000, most of them Muslims, since June 2012. The latest bloodshed in Thandwe shows Myanmar's reformist government struggling to curb the spread of a Buddhist nationalist movement known as 969 and control members of an ethnic Rakhine political party implicated in violence. The 969 movement is led by firebrand monks who preach that Islam is a threat and urge supporters to shun interfaith marriage and boycott Muslim-run businesses. The numbers symbolise the Buddha, his teachings and the monkhood. Many anti-Muslim attacks have taken place where monks have preached the 969 creed but the violence had ebbed in recent weeks until the Thandwe attacks. Police in Thandwe say they have arrested six people, including the local chairman of the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party (RNDP) and supporters of the 969 movement. RNDP members were implicated in anti-Muslim violence last October in which at least 89 people were killed, a Reuters investigation found. The latest violence coincided with a three-day visit to Rakhine State by President Thein Sein. Tension was high as he arrived in Thandwe on Wednesday, with police firing shots in the air to disperse a crowd. \"ENEMY BASES\" Evidence of 969 activity is hard to miss. Banners bearing the movement's logo flank roads to Ngapali beach. Muslims said 969 supporters had recently blasted Buddhist nationalistic songs from speakers at Thandwe town hall. That followed a sermon in Shwe Hlay village by a prominent 969 monk called Wirathu, who once described mosques as \"enemy bases\". \"After that, we had to be very careful in the village and not bump into Buddhists or make them angry,\" said Myint Aung, one of scores of Muslim residents of Tha Phyu Chai village huddled near one of the few homes left standing. Wirathu's admirers include Sann Sint, minister of religious affairs, who told Reuters in June the monk only promoted \"love and understanding between religions\". President Thein Sein has called Wirathu \"a son of Lord Buddha\" and said 969 \"is just a symbol of peace\". About five percent of Myanmar's 60 million people are Muslim, according to government estimates. About a million more are Rohingya Muslims, mostly stateless and living in northern Rakhine State. Maung Myint Htay, a Buddhist resident of Tha Phyu Chai, said he played no part in Tuesday's attacks, but didn't condemn them. \"It's not wrong,\" he said, adding that Rakhine people had a \"historical duty\" to protect their homeland from Muslims. Myint Moe of a group called the Committee for the Protection of Religion and Nationality acknowledged that he distributed 969 stickers and had the support of hundreds of Buddhist monks. Myint Moe rejected the name \"Rohingya\" and instead referred to members of that community as \"Bengalis\", a term that implies they are illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. An RNDP official in Thandwe said the arrest of party members could cause more unrest. \"It's the responsibility of the government because they arrested the party leader and religious leaders,\" said Maung Maung Phyu. \"People are angry.\" (Amends transliteration of name in paragraph three to Tun.)

Adobe dropped the bombshell revelation shortly after KrebsonSecurity's Brian Krebs reported that the hack began sometime in mid August and was carried out by the same criminals who breached LexisNexis and other major US data brokers. In the course of investigating the earlier intrusions, Krebs said he happened upon a 40 gigabyte trove of source code, much of it belonging to Adobe. Adobe confirmed its ColdFusion Web application software and its Acrobat document program were among those that were stolen. A new generation of exploits The Acrobat software family, which is intimately linked to the nearly ubiquitous Reader application, has long been a favorite target of malware developers looking for ways to sneak their malicious wares onto people's computers. The specter of hackers having full access to the raw source code of those applications is troubling, because it could make it easier to identify bugs that can be surreptitiously exploited in drive-by website attacks. \"This breach poses a serious concern to countless businesses and individuals,\" a statement issued by Holder Security , which assisted in Krebs's investigation, warned. \"While we are not aware of specific use of data from the source code, we fear that disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data. Effectively, this breach may have opened a gateway for a new generation of viruses, malware, and exploits.\" Adobe Chief Security Officer Brad Arkin said officials aren't aware of any unpatched vulnerabilities being targeted in any of the company's products. \"However, as always, we recommend customers run only supported versions of the software, apply all available security updates, and follow the advice of the Acrobat Enterprise Toolkit and the ColdFusion Lockdown Guide ,\" he added. He thanked Krebs and Alex Holden of Hold Security for their help in responding to the intrusion. Krebs said Adobe engineers are still in the process of checking on the integrity of its source code. The investigation includes looking for \"anomalous check-in activity on its code repositories,\" which could indicate the intruders were able to introduce backdoors or security bugs or otherwise tamper with the underlying applications. \"We are looking at malware analysis and exploring the different digital assets we have,\" Arkin told Krebs. \"Right now the investigation is really into the trail of breadcrumbs of where the bad guys touched.\" In an advisory , Arkin said attackers removed information for 2.9 million customers from company computers. That data included customer names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and other information relating to orders. Attackers also accessed customer IDs and \"encrypted\" (by which Adobe probably means cryptographically hashed) passwords. Customer passwords will be reset, and Arkin recommended customers change passwords on other sites if they matched those used in their Adobe accounts. Arkin said company employees have notified banks that process customer payments so they can work with payment card companies and card-issuing banks to protect customer accounts. Krebs said that one of the related intrusions he uncovered\u2014into the network of the National White Collar Crime Center\u2014appears to have been initiated by exploiting weaknesses in Adobe's ColdFusion product. While Adobe plugged all known security holes in the product a few months ago, many networks run outdated versions that expose the users to serious hacks. \"This indeed may have also been the vector that attackers used to infiltrate Adobe's own networks,\" Krebs said.", "lede": "Adobe said it suffered a sustained compromise of its corporate ne...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/adobe-source-code-and-customer-data-stolen-in-sustained-network-hack/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Hackers Hit Adobe Systems' Network", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 07:57:02", "content": "Answers allows you to tap the knowledge of Community members.

But for now, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda saw no need to ease policy further as Japan was on the path to escape deflation and, if international risks receded as hoped, government fiscal stimulus would further boost growth next year. The U.S. budget deadlock and fears of an unprecedented U.S. default dragged Tokyo shares to a four-week low and boosted the yen, casting a cloud on an otherwise upbeat outlook for Japan's export-driven economy. \"If this continues for a long time, this could destabilize financial markets and worsen sentiment,\" Kuroda told reporters after a two-day policy review meeting, adding that the BOJ was ready to respond to any sudden shocks. He declined to comment on the possibility of a U.S. debt default, but said the consequences of a prolonged standoff on global markets would be \"severe.\" \"We sincerely hope a solution is reached at an early date,\" Kuroda said. Through its massive holding of U.S. government debt, Japan is one America's biggest creditors. Other top international policymakers have also warned that a failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling before mid-month would be a serious blow to the world economy. As widely expected, the BOJ kept intact its intense monetary stimulus launched in April, under which it aims to double base money via asset purchases to meet its target of lifting inflation to 2 percent in roughly two years. EYES GDP REVISION UPGRADE On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would proceed with a planned increase in the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent next April, and cushion its impact with a 5 trillion yen ($51 billion) stimulus package. Kuroda said the tax rise was an important first step in reining in Japan's huge public debt which, at double the size of its $5 trillion economy, is the biggest among major industrialized nations. He also said the stimulus package would give a significant boost to growth, suggesting the central bank will revise up its long-term economic forecasts when they are released on October 31. The BOJ upgraded its assessment on capital expenditure to say it was picking up, adding strength to its view the economy was recovering moderately and suggesting that no additional monetary policy measures are needed to counter the impact of the sales tax increase. Japan's economy has now grown for three successive quarters as Abe's reflationary policies bolstered household spending and drove down the yen, benefiting exports, with annualized growth of 3.8 percent in April-June outpacing many G7 nations. The BOJ expects the sales tax hike to shave about 0.7 percentage point off growth, and estimates the economy will expand 1.3 percent in the business year beginning in April 2014. This already far outpaces the 0.7 percent growth projected in a recent Reuters poll, and its forecast does not factor in the effect of the government's stimulus package. \"I don't think the BOJ's view that the sales tax hike won't derail the recovery is too optimistic,\" said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities. \"But the 2 percent inflation remains a distant goal. Core consumer inflation could hit 1 percent early next year. But it's an uphill battle from there.\" Having launched its intense burst of stimulus in April, the BOJ does not want to act again easily. But it has not ruled out expanding stimulus if the damage from the tax hike proves bigger than expected and threatens the 2 percent inflation target. The big test will come in spring next year, and not just from the sales tax. By then there will also be more clarity on whether companies will raise wages enough to offset some of the pain households will feel from the tax hike, BOJ officials say.

A set of redefining technological trends is reshaping the landscape from a slow and cumbersome process practiced mainly by large enterprises to a much more flexible, agile process that mid-market companies as well as individuals can utilize. This report explores the key features that influence the evolution of agile BI and takes a look at the BI landscape under this light. At first glance, polarization seems to exist between traditional BI vendors, who are focused on extract, transform, and load (ETL) and reporting, and the newcomers, who are focused on data exploration and visualization, but a closer look reveals that, in fact, they converge as adoption of useful features is taking place across the spectrum. This report will illustrate for both the traditional BI vendors and the newcomers that: As the market is expanding, features such as cloud support and embedded domain-specific knowledge in BI solutions are key. Initially, the benefits will be more obvious to those smaller players who do not have the resources for in-house infrastructure and extended internal projects and who are driven more by needing immediate results. Over the long run, however, these features can benefit all types of organizations. Ubiquity and mobility are key features of data today; therefore, the ability to support a multitude of data sources with as little effort as possible \u2013 integrating them and accessing analysis results via a multitude of channels \u2013 is important in order to keep up.

It's also geared toward first-time smartphone owners with its simple interface and an $80 unlocked price. This combination of open, standards-based software and affordable hardware sounds like a dream for both developers and newcomers alike. But is that how it works in practice? Read our review and you'll find out. &#13; ZTE Open review &#13; See all photos &#13; 25 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; Hardware The design of the Open is an exercise in minimalism. A close cousin of the Android-based Kis III , it feels like a large, smooth pebble -- albeit one covered in soft-touch plastic. It's very comfortable to hold as a result, although the thin back cover and smudge-prone 3.5-inch screen will remind you that you're using a low-end handset. ZTE does deserve some kudos for embracing Firefox's native colors -- whether you buy an Open in blue or orange, your phone is destined to stand out. The back-to-basics philosophy extends to the controls and ports. Aside from the screen, the only features on the front are an LED (for charging only) and a capacitive home button. There's no front-facing camera, unfortunately. On the left is a volume rocker that's easy to use by feel alone; the top holds both a power button and a headphone jack, while the micro-USB port and microphone sit at the bottom. You'll find only a 2-megapixel camera and speaker on the back, although it's easy to pop off the rear cover and get access to both the 1,200mAh battery as well as the SIM and microSDHC card slots. That accessibility is essential, too, as the built-in 512MB of storage isn't enough to hold a media collection. The eBay version (available in the US and UK) doesn't ship with any microSD expansion, although carriers like Movistar Spain include a 4GB card in the box. As you've likely gathered, the Open will disappoint if you're looking for clever hardware tricks. There are no shortcut keys, notification lights or water resistance . About all you'll get for luxury is an FM radio. However, there's a refreshing simplicity to the design. It's tailor-made for newcomers to the smartphone world who don't need (or don't care for) any frills. While we wish that the components inside were more powerful, the form factor is at least appealing. ZTE Open Dimensions 114 x 62 x 12.5 mm (4.5 x 2.4 x 0.5 inches) Weight 120g (4.2 oz) Screen size 3.5 inches Screen resolution 480 x 320 Screen type TFT LCD Battery 1,200mAh lithium-ion (removable) Internal storage 512MB External storage MicroSDHC, up to 32GB Rear camera 2MP (fixed-focus) Front-facing cam None Video capture 352 x 288 NFC No Radios GSM GPRS / EDGE (850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900); HSDPA (850 / 1900) Bluetooth v2.1 SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM7225A CPU 1GHz single-core ARM Cortex-A5 GPU Adreno 200 RAM 256MB Entertainment None (USB mass storage for transfers) WiFi Dual-band, 802.11a/b/g/n Wireless Charging No Operating system Firefox OS 1.1 (1.0.1 on current units) Display Many smartphones under $100 have very basic displays, and that's exactly what you'll get with the Open. At 3.5 inches, the LCD is a bit too small for fast typing with Mozilla's on-screen keyboard. The 480 x 320 resolution is usable, but not exactly sharp. Colors are adequate (if flat) head-on, but they wash out when you view the phone from a sharp angle. The screen is at least readable in sunlight, though. To us, responsiveness is the display's main flaw. Despite using capacitive input, the Open's touchscreen just isn't very sensitive or accurate. It was too easy for us to miss a photo opportunity because our shutter press didn't register, or to launch an app when we meant to scroll. Even swiping down the notification bar requires a bit more effort than we're used to. The unresponsiveness is occasionally frustrating, and we'd expect better even at this modest price point. It wouldn't take much to get a significantly improved display, either. Contrast the Open with a more expensive (if still frugal) phone like the LG Optimus L3 II : LG may have shed some screen resolution, but its display is both more responsive and produces richer colors. While ZTE doesn't have to compete in the Optimus L3 II's price bracket, it should have spent more on the screen. Camera We'll be blunt: the Open's 2-megapixel rear camera is terrible, even by the standards of entry-level phone photography. Virtually every photo is full of blocky compression artifacts, noise and color inaccuracies. Well-lit photos in any environment are defined by purple fringing effects and blown-out highlights, while low-light images lose most of the visible detail. There's no flash to fill in that detail, and the fixed focus rules out any macro shots. We'd still take the Open's camera over none at all, but that's not exactly a compliment. &#13; ZTE Open sample shots &#13; See all photos &#13; 26 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; This isn't helped by the camera software, which is as rudimentary as it gets. Your options are to shoot photos, shoot videos or visit the gallery app -- and that's it. There are no settings or special modes. While there's a healthy selection of editing and sharing options in the gallery, such as cropping and exposure compensation, you'll have little input when taking the snapshot. Thankfully, Mozilla's Principal Developer Evangelist Christian Heilmann tells us that the basic feature set is due more to the hardware than the OS. We'd expect more advanced phones to get improved controls. Just be warned that video recording is equally crude, if not more so. You can only shoot 352 x 188, 20 fps movies with single-channel sound. The image quality is decent for the resolution, but the audio is worse than a phone call. We'd use the Open's video mode only as a last resort. Software This is why you're reading, really. The Open is the first taste of Firefox OS for many people, including programmers who want to test their Firefox OS apps on a real device. As such, a quick explanation of the platform is in order. At its heart, Firefox OS is a Linux variant that runs HTML5-based web apps instead of native code, even for hardware-dependent features like phone calls. Mozilla believes that its web focus liberates mobile app development ; by using open standards like HTML5, developers won't be locked into supporting just one device ecosystem. It could also make smartphones more affordable, as devices won't need to store apps that primarily run online. As Heilmann explains, it's meant to deliver a smartphone experience to those who'd otherwise buy a basic cellphone -- not to become the \"next iOS or Android.\" It may be a while before we get Firefox OS software that feels completely at home in the modern smartphone world. The basic experience will be familiar to anyone who has used iOS or Android, since it borrows a few concepts from both. Users get a basic home screen with a search box, a tray of customizable app shortcuts and an expandable notification bar with quick settings. Swiping to the right scrolls through your apps. Like iOS, almost every navigation element is onscreen; while that consumes extra space, it's potentially simpler for users who haven't tried (or just don't want) hardware keys. Ultimately, the interface is easy enough to understand that it takes just a few minutes to learn the ins and outs of the platform. That's no doubt the point. Mozilla wants even first-time smartphone owners to feel at home, and we'd say that the company succeeded. That simplicity extends to the search box, which epitomizes the web-based strategy of Firefox OS. Officially known as the adaptive app search field, the box shows web results as though they were apps, not pages. Look for sushi and you'll get icons for the likes of Epicurious (for sushi recipes) or Google Maps (to find nearby sushi places). Any relevant local apps appear in the list, and you can \"install\" any result as an app. The approach is simple and largely works, although it may be slightly confusing to users who won't always see an explanation of where a web link will go. Thankfully, they can always use the Firefox browser to see traditional, text-based web results. &#13; ZTE Open software photos &#13; See all photos &#13; 16 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; We have mixed reactions to this emphasis on web apps. The philosophy lets developers quickly port apps to Firefox OS, and lets phone makers include a lot of apps that aren't always available beyond major platforms. Our test unit shipped with third-party apps like AccuWeather, Facebook, Nokia's Here Maps , Twitter, Wikipedia and YouTube. However, this can be frustrating when you realize that most existing Firefox OS apps aren't much more capable than a mobile-optimized website. Here Maps can cache an area you're looking at for offline use, as it can elsewhere, but you can't jump over to Here Drive (like on Windows Phone) to get turn-by-turn navigation. Accordingly, you tend to lose major functionality present in native apps on other platforms, like most forms of push notifications and inter-app communication. Mozilla tells us that cross-app support is rolling out, and that app notifications will come in the OS' 1.2 upgrade; still, it may be a while before we get Firefox OS software that feels completely at home in the modern smartphone world. It's difficult to realize exactly what you're missing, as there aren't many apps in the Firefox Marketplace, Mozilla's official store. While that's somewhat forgivable given the web push and Firefox OS' limited market presence, it also leaves us hard-pressed to find the big-name apps that we like. Right now, many Firefox OS programs are filling holes left by better-known titles: Check-In Fox replaces Foursquare, for example, while Sketchbook Squad substitutes for Doodle Jump . We have noticed major releases like Pulse and SoundCloud , but they're in the minority. Discovery is limited to finding the newest or most popular apps in a given category. Although Firefox Marketplace will undoubtedly grow in the months ahead, it currently doesn't hold a candle to mature app portals like the App Store, Google Play or the Windows Phone Store. The OS itself is equally young. The Open unit we received is running a pre-release version of Firefox OS 1.1, which introduces surprisingly basic features like MMS and a search option in the music app. The phones on the market as of this writing are still using 1.0.1, and there's no word on whether or not they'll get 1.1 or later. Mozilla says that it can push security fixes itself -- an important advantage over some platforms -- but that bigger updates will usually require carrier or manufacturer approval. Regardless of the OS version, many of the stock apps include only the bare essentials. You can't put a video on repeat, for instance, and media syncing is limited to copying files in USB mass storage mode. Concepts like NFC and voice recognition just don't exist in Firefox OS at this stage, and there's no guarantee that they will, given the focus on low-cost, open technology. Firefox OS may be a great introduction to smartphones, but it's limiting for seasoned users. Performance and battery life Gauging the Open's performance is far trickier than it is with other devices. It's not just that we're looking at our first Firefox OS device, which prevents many direct comparisons; it's also that there are very few benchmarking tools. Still, there's enough here to give a clear indication of how well ZTE's handset deals with common tasks. Mozilla needs more capable hardware to demonstrate Firefox OS' potential. Getting around the OS is smooth enough. Although the Open is running on just a 1GHz, single-core Snapdragon MSM7225A and 256MB of RAM, the home screen, browser and many apps are mostly stutter-free. The hardware could keep up with a few 2D action games, too. Just don't expect a media powerhouse. We couldn't play H.264-encoded 720p video, and there aren't yet 3D games available (though WebGL makes these possible). More importantly, browsing -- Firefox OS' very reason for being -- falls a bit short. Everyday web surfing is fine, but more sophisticated pages and web apps either take a while to load or periodically bog down. That subjective experience is supported by our web benchmarking. The Open took 3,665ms to complete the SunSpider JavaScript test, or more than twice as long as the Lumia 520 (1,400ms). It's more comparable to the 2009-era Motorola Milestone , better known as the GSM equivalent to the Droid ; it wasn't much slower at 4,628ms. We tried other web tests to play it safe, and the results were less than flattering. Kraken, Mozilla's own JavaScript benchmark, took 67,371ms to complete where a Moto X we have on hand (admittedly, well beyond the Open's league) can finish that same test in 9,295ms. Google's Octane wouldn't even run on the Open -- it took several tries just to reach the page without an error, and the phone would invariably give up partway through. Cellular data is also an issue. We're not concerned about the Open's modest HSPA speeds, which on Canada's Telus network averaged about 3.1 Mbps for downloads and 1.3 Mbps for uploads. It's the reception that sours the experience. The Open is very sensitive to signal changes, and it's considerably more likely to drop its data link (at least in Ottawa) where other devices using the same 3G service work properly. When a phone that absolutely needs a good internet connection has trouble sustaining that connection, there's a serious problem. Battery life, on the other hand, is superb. Whatever gripes we might have with the basic software feature set, it keeps the Open running for a long time on a small lithium-ion pack. We couldn't run our usual looping video test, but it was easy to last through a day of moderate-to-heavy use that included several checks of both Facebook and Twitter, a similar amount of browsing, a 20-minute call, 20 photos and two short videos. Based on less-strenuous use after our formal testing, we could see the Open lasting for two or even three days without a fresh charge. Call quality is also good. In reasonably quiet situations, both ends of the call are loud and generally quite clear. There's no noise-canceling microphone, though, so you'll have to shout if you're in a loud environment. The rear speaker puts out sound at moderate volumes, and it isn't anything to write home about. Wrap-up We should reiterate what we said earlier in the review: the ZTE Open is partly intended as a developer phone. For those customers, it does the job well. You don't need a quad-core processor or a 1080p display to demonstrate that your HTML5 app runs properly. For $80 unlocked, the smartphone is even something of a bargain; it's cheap enough that you could buy several for a programming team. If you're looking for a testbed device, don't hesitate to pick one up. There are also certain everyday customers who might like the Open. If you're just considering a smartphone for the first time and object to the complexity or cost of what's on the market, it's hard to beat the pricing. On Movistar Spain, the Open costs \u20ac58 ($78) with prepaid service; the Optimus L3 II is twice as expensive, at \u20ac116 ($156). Travel to Colombia and the 149,900 pesos (also $78) that you'll pay at Movistar will easily undercut a phone like Samsung's Galaxy Young , which costs 317,900 pesos ($167). Mozilla argues that Firefox OS brings smartphones to a wider audience, and it's right -- some customers would be relegated to a basic feature phone if the Open weren't available. For many of you reading this, the Open won't make sense. The price differences between the Open and more advanced devices either won't matter as much, or aren't that large to start with. Americans will want to look at the Nokia Lumia 620 from Aio Wireless -- it's only slightly more expensive at $100 prepaid, but much more powerful. If you can spend $30 more beyond that, you may also want to consider a few Samsung phones, such as the Galaxy Amp (at Aio Wireless) and Galaxy Reverb (at Virgin Mobile). It's a tougher call if you're in Spain or another market where these deals aren't available, but we would investigate phones like the Optimus L3 II or Sony Xperia E . The Open is fine as a child's first phone or a backup device, however. Whether or not the Open fits your needs, one thing is clear: Mozilla needs more capable hardware to demonstrate Firefox OS' potential. The Open is good for someone whose alternative would be a basic flip phone, but the camera quality, connectivity, display and performance don't do full justice to the software. Thankfully, more smartphones are coming. Along with a more powerful ZTE phone , we can also expect the (unsanctioned) Geeksphone Peak+ . The as-yet-unannounced devices from Huawei and LG may also be worth waiting for. Firefox OS could easily take off -- it just needs a better launch vehicle. &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;", "lede": "&#13; As the first Firefox OS smartphone, the ZTE Open is an amba...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/zte-open-review/"}, {"author": "Richard Lawler", "title": "Google Glassware Review Process opens, gives devs a path to MyGlass listing", "feed_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:14:00", "content": "&#13; Developers eagerly working on services for the Google Glass headset finally have a clear avenue for release, now that the Glassware Review Process is ready.

This mobile app, called Circa News , doesn\u2019t give you articles. It gives you an endless stream of new information \u2014 the most important facts of the day, delivered as quickly as they arrive on the web. \u201cWe call it atomization,\u201d Galligan says. \u201cWe take a story, break it down into its core elements, and then tell that story over time.\u201d It\u2019s an intriguing crusade that seeks to reduce the time needed to digest the daily news \u2014 you can take in each new fact in between everything else you\u2019re doing on your phone, from checking email to posting pics on Facebook \u2014 and it only gets more interesting when Galligan mentions the rather unexpected place where he and his company drew their inspiration. They\u2019re reinventing news in the image of open source software code. Circa is yet another way that the very geeky world of programming is the way we do so many other things, from renovating houses to penning wedding invitations to writing laws . As it turns out, the way we build software code is also a great way to build just about anything. Galligan calls himself a serial entrepreneur, but he\u2019s also someone who has tried his hand at building software \u2014 at least on a small scale. More than a year ago, he teamed up with Ben Huh \u2014 the man whose Cheezburger blogging network reinvented online cat videos \u2014 to create a company that would overhaul the idea of online news. But the Circa app didn\u2019t really take shape until Galligan and a few tech-types got together and someone mentioned \u201cversion control.\u201d That\u2019s geek-speak for systems like GitHub , the widely popular online service that lets people collaborate on software projects. Anyone can add new code to a project through something called a \u201cpull request.\u201d They can instantly create a new project by \u201cforking\u201d an existing piece of code. And they can just as easily merge pieces of code together. What the Circa team realized is that they could treat news in much the same way. They could separate it into tiny pieces and use these pieces to build stories as time goes on. \u201cRather than write an article,\u201d says Galligan, \u201cwe decided to write stories as code gets written.\u201d Galligan employs a team of writers who distill a breaking story into a handful of key facts, and then, as the story develops, they can add new facts \u2014 or they can separate a key fact and use it as the basis for a new storyline. If the original story is the bombing of the Boston Marathon, for instance, it might branch into a separate story about the manhunt for the suspected bombers. \u201cNews works in this way,\u201d Galigan says. \u201cYou might work down one storyline for a while, but then it might fork .\u201d The metaphor then extends to everyone who uses the Circa mobile app. With the app, you can \u201cfollow\u201d stories in much the same way you follow someone posting to Twitter or, yes, follow software projects hosted on GitHub. If a story forks, you can then follow the fork too. Rather than reading articles, you\u2019re reading streams of news. \u201cI compare it to the Presidential Daily Brief,\u201d says Lane Wood, a longtime Circa user. \u201cYou get all the important information, and you get it really quickly and concisely \u2014 in a way that you can just easily consume it from your phone. You\u2019re in and you\u2019re out, and you\u2019re informed.\u201d Lane is currently following a story on the government shutdown. \u201cI could sift through Google News for a lot of long articles,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really, all I want to know is: Was there any progress made? What happened? Who said what? Those small, snippet updates are delivered to me, and I know exactly what\u2019s new.\u201d The app has been available for iPhone for more than a year, and today, Galligan and company released a version for Android phones as well. It now includes what Galligan calls \u201cnews alerts,\u201d which means the app will actively notify you when an important story has broken. With the click of an icon, you can then instantly follow that story as you would any other. Some may scoff at the idea of atomizing news in this way. But it\u2019s the way the world is moving. \u201cNews used to compete with news,\u201d says Galligan. \u201cBut now it competes with Angry Birds and Snapchat.\u201d For so many of us, Twitter itself has become a de facto news feed. We treat our world like an endless stream of tiny things \u2014 be they ideas or tasks or little bits of fun \u2014 and then, through machines, we collect and shape these things into something larger.

The company is apparently out of money, having spent the $6 billion it has raised since its inception in 2000. For the time being, it has stopped buying new patents. According to the material IV gave to prospective investors, which were reviewed by Reuters, the company has achieved average return of 16.2 percent on the first patent fund it put together, in 2003. Its second fund, completed in 2008, has achieved an average of return of 2.5 percent. Those numbers seem somewhat questionable, though, in light of one of the few publicly available sources of IV returns. The\u00a0University of Texas Investment Management Company, or UTIMCO, was an early investor in IV and is required by law to disclose its annual returns. UTIMCO invested $50 million in IV's 2008 fund, but the value of its stake has decreased by about four percent, making it the fifth-worst investment that investment group made in 2008.

Obama had planned to depart on Saturday for a four-nation, week-long trip. He canceled visits to Malaysia and the Philippines earlier this week because of his budget struggle in the U.S. Congress and said late on Thursday he would not attend the regional summits in Indonesia and Brunei. The political standoff over the U.S. budget has shut down non-essential government services and appeared likely to drag on for another week or longer. Another crisis looms in two weeks when lawmakers must decide whether to increase the U.S. government's $16.7 trillion debt borrowing limit. \"The president made this decision based on the difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown, and his determination to continue pressing his case that Republicans should immediately allow a vote to reopen the government,\" the White House said. Obama was scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, among other leaders, at the summits. Two of his main aims would have been to discuss the Syria crisis with Putin and to hold talks on a maritime code of conduct for disputed territories in the oil- and gas-rich South China Sea. \"We are disappointed,\" said Indonesian Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring on the island of Bali, host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from Sunday. \"I think the summit will go on, there is a long-term plan. (But) without Obama, you can imagine how disappointed we are. We could hardly imagine he wouldn't come.\" Obama was also scheduled to attend the East Asia Summit, organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in Brunei next week. Xi, who was on a visit to Malaysia on Friday, did not comment on Obama's decision. But analysts said the no-show by the U.S. president would work to China's advantage. \"While his decision is perfectly understandable, it projects a poor image of America as a country that is politically dysfunctional and on the verge of another economic crisis,\" said Ian Storey, senior fellow at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. \"Meanwhile, cash-rich and self-confident China will have the floor to itself.\" Obama twice postponed visits to Indonesia and Australia in 2010, because of a health reform bill and then because of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. He was absent from the APEC meeting last year in Vladivostok, Russia because of a Democratic Party convention. SEVERE DILEMMA In Tokyo, Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said Abe would attend the summits as planned. \"This is a domestic problem of the United States,\" he said. \"We hope the (Obama) administration and Congress negotiate earnestly to solve the problem as early as possible, so that the problem won't be affecting various issues.\" Storey said the latest domestic crisis was posing a severe dilemma for Obama, since it clashed with a cherished foreign policy objective. At the APEC and East Asia Summits two years ago, Obama announced the U.S. strategic pivot, or rebalancing, toward Asia, which was seen as a reaction to the growing clout of China. \"On the one hand he needs to be in Asia to demonstrate America's commitment to the region and especially to the ASEAN-led regional security architecture that has been one of the central planks of his administration's Asia policy,\" said Storey. \"But with government employees on unpaid leave, Obama cannot afford to leave Washington and be seen hob-nobbing with world leaders on a tropical island.\" The Washington stalemate has idled hundreds of thousands of federal government workers and comes two weeks before Washington faces an even more crucial deadline - raising the U.S. debt limit so the United States can pay its bills. A bitter debate rages over that issue as well and if left unresolved could result in a U.S. debt default. Denis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific region, said not too much should be read into Obama's decision to call off the tour. \"I would read nothing more into the postponement of President Obama's trip than that he has to stay on and take care of this (crisis),\" he told reporters in Manila. \"I'm very confident that he will reschedule and frankly it will be a better visit if he's not on the phone having to call back home to get reports on the latest development there.\" Secretary of State John Kerry will lead delegations to both summits in place of Obama. Kerry will also go to Malaysia and the Philippines. Obama phoned both President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the Sultan of Brunei to inform them of his decision, the White House said. Obama looks forward to working with Asian allies and returning to the region at a later date, the White House said.

Apple is likely to use the acquisition, or its talent, to bolster the offerings of its Today section with additional signals curated from email, social networks and more. This would improve the utility of the section, which is fairly sparse right now, and enable Apple to more vigorously compete with Google Now. Google\u2019s service already collates data from all of its services and networks, offering proactive information and assistance to users on Android (and in the iOS Search app). Siri and iOS 7\u2032s new Today section of the Notification Center simply don\u2019t compare to Google Now in-depth, usability or overall power. The ability of Google to tap into the deep array of contextual data that people have living in their Gmail inboxes and other Google products is being leveraged wonderfully by the Google Now team. I\u2019ve said before that Google Now can be considered reason enough to buy an Android phone, and I don\u2019t think Apple is blind to how good it is. With iOS 7, Apple introduced Today as a way to show you upcoming appointments, weather and basic directions to home or to work. This is sort of skimming the top of what is possible with the host of sensors your smartphone has available to it and the troves of data that you store in your inbox and other services. It doesn\u2019t dip into your Mail.app data, or provide information based on your location besides simple \u2018get there\u2019 directions.\u00a0 Google Now does all of that and a lot more, providing transit instructions and recommendations on timing if you\u2019re traveling. The card-based interface of Google Now offers a really compelling experience that only Google is churning through enough data to replicate. Apple ostensibly has similar data available to it, especially for heavy iCloud users, but it doesn\u2019t leverage it. There\u2019s just nothing on iOS that compares to the power of Google Now, including Siri and the Today feature. Much of that lies in Google Now\u2019s predictive nature. It doesn\u2019t just tell you what\u2019s going on now, it anticipates the information you might need and delivers it to you\u00a0 before you need it. The iOS version of the Google Now service is prevented from doing a lot of this because it has no deep access to the system. This is where things get interesting, as the Cue acquisition could be used to make Siri more powerful and aware, notifying you either via push notification or voice of things you may not even know you needed. The early arrival of a flight or train, congestion along your favorite route to work, and more. Push notifications are the future of how we communicate with our smart devices, whether they\u2019re pocketable or wearable. Making sure that any that Siri or Today might send are content rich and relevant is an important problem. The close integration of Siri as a responsive system and \u2018Today\u2019 as a proactive system could be greatly aided by the contextual information that was the core of Cue\u2019s feature set. Cue originally leveraged social accounts to provide an accurate picture of what things you had coming up and what you\u2019re going to do. Later in life it turned its attention primarily to email. The experience of the app itself was never \u2018amazing\u2019, per se, but they definitely their claws deep into email parsing and signaling. And that expertise could help beyond just Siri and Today as well, it could also give other apps like Calendar a contextual steroid shot. Rather than getting context-free dates and names there is potential here for Apple to offer a Calendar app that actually helps you get things done , rather than just remind you\u00a0 when\u00a0 things are due. Apps like Sunrise calendar and Donna are displaying what can be done with smartphone sensors and volunteered user data. That\u2019s just the beginning of what\u2019s possible if you own the bones of the OS. These kinds of acquisitions are exactly the kind that Apple likes to make. Small, talented teams that offer it the ability to either implement a new feature or augment an existing one. The proactive use of data in service of the user will be the defining feature of the next generation of smartphones. It will be interesting to see what the Cue team manages to get done.", "lede": "Apple has acquired the \u2018smart assistant\u2019 company Cue, for over $4...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/why-did-apple-buy-cue-because-google-now-eats-siris-lunch/"}, {"author": "Ina Fried", "title": "Apple Posts Fix for Mountain Lion Update That Caused Webcam Problems", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:51:53", "content": "Apple is releasing a software patch on Thursday designed to fix a problem with the latest Mac OS X update that caused the built-in camera in some recent Mac Book Air laptops to no longer function properly.

Apple According to notices on Apple's developer site , Apple has just issued a Golden Master build of OS X 10.9 to all registered developers today. Like the \"release to manufacturing\" builds in the Windows world, a GM build is usually the last stop on the way to public release. Apple has also issued a GM build of Xcode 5.0.1, which is necessary for building OS X 10.9 apps that will be submitted to the Mac App Store\u2014Xcode 5.0 was released in September with\u00a0 iOS 7 . OS X 10.9 (also known as Mavericks) was announced alongside iOS 7 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, and while it isn't the complete overhaul that iOS 7 is it ushers in many improvements targeted specifically at power users. Among these features is a new tabbed version of the Finder that makes it easier to organize files, and changes that make multiple-monitor setups more useful. New under-the-hood additions like compressed memory, timer coalescing, and \"App Nap\" should also reduce resource usage while increasing battery life . Apple still hasn't announced pricing or availability details for Mavericks beyond the vague \"this fall\" promise it made at WWDC, but we'd expect the company to release the software before the end of October. The rumor mill expects Apple to hold an event in the middle of the month to announce refreshed iPads, and a Mavericks announcement would pair nicely with some new Haswell-equipped Retina MacBook Pros or perhaps the redesigned Mac Pro . Apple could also do what it did with Lion and Mountain Lion and announce Mavericks during its Q4 2013 earnings call, which ought to happen at some point before the end of October. As we've\u00a0 previously reported , Mavericks is compatible with any Mac that can currently run OS X 10.8.\u00a0We'll be publishing our usual in-depth reviews of both OS X 10.9 and its accompanying OS X Server update after Apple releases the software to the public.", "lede": "Enlarge / OS X 10.9 will soon be crashing down upon us.

This source says that the operating system will reach Golden Master status internally by the end of this week or early next week, and it will be labeled as a build number in the high 13A590s or low 13A600s. This will be a slight increase over the current developer build that is version 13A584.\u00a0Earlier today, Apple seeded OS X Mavericks build 13A598 to members of its AppleSeed program, but it is unclear if that new version will ever reach developers. AppleSeed members believe that this build is a GM candidate, but a source says that Apple is already internally seeding newer builds.\u00a0The source has also corroborated our previous report by indicating that OS X Mavericks is currently scheduled to arrive on the Mac App Store within the last ten days of the month of October. Mavericks was supposed to reach GM status a few weeks ago, but critical bugs have kept pushing back the release, according to claims from sources. Since being announced at WWDC, OS X Mavericks is said to have picked up a few minor unannounced features. Namely, the Messages and FaceTime applications have received the ability to block phone numbers and Apple IDs from sending the Mavericks user messages and/or FaceTime calls. This addition brings parity to iOS 7 and the two operating systems will sync in this manner. While this enhancement is probably not surprising, it has not been present in any Mavericks Developer Preview to date. Mavericks will also bring the launch of iCloud Keychain\u2026 With OS X Mavericks nearing its public debut, and iOS 7 having arrived last month, Apple is said to already have diverted the majority of its OS X and iOS resources to development of the next two Apple operating systems: OS X 10.10 and iOS 8. Views to 9to5Mac from 10.10 began in September OS X 10.10 is internally codenamed Syrah (yes, another wine ), and sources hint that Apple has been toying with a new design across the system that is akin, but not as dramatically different, to the new designs found in iOS 7 and iCloud.com. As for iOS 8, development of that OS is making headway, and it will likely bring feature enhancements to Maps. Yesterday we reported that Apple has begun\u00a0 training its AppleCare support staff on OS X Mavericks. While OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 are not scheduled to be announced until next summer, users can expect a few updates in the near future (in addition to Mavericks): a new version of OS X 10.8.5 launched today , and we expect iOS 7.0.3 and iOS 7.1 to arrive by the end of the year. Apple also has several hardware releases still up its sleeve for this fall including multiple new iPads, Macs, and perhaps a fresh TV-related device .

Twitter says that along with things like monthly active users, ad revenue per timeline view is one of the key metrics it uses to evaluate its business. The company treats timeline views (\u201cthe total number of timelines requested when registered users visit Twitter, refresh a timeline or view search results while logged in on our website, mobile website or desktop or mobile applications\u201d) as a measure of user engagement, and it uses ad revenue per timeline view to track its ability to make money from that engagement. By that measure, Twitter\u2019s ability to monetize is improving. It says advertising revenue per timeline view was $0.80 for the three months ending on June 30 of this year, up 26 percent from the same period in 2012. That number is significantly higher in the United States ($2.17) compared to the rest of the world ($0.30), though the international number is up 111 percent year-over-year. Why invent an entirely new ad metric (and one without a handy acronym)? Well, Twitter has an unusual advertising model, with advertisers paying to promote tweets, trends, and accounts in users\u2019 news feeds, so the standard ad measurement of CPMs (the cost per thousand impressions) may not apply. The fact that \u201cadvertising revenue per timeline view\u201d actually measures revenue for every 1,000 timeline views suggests that this metric may be a proxy of sorts for CPMs. (It\u2019s probably a little dodgy to compare Twitter\u2019s numbers with traditional CPMs, but hey, just for fun \u2014 according to eMarketer, Facebook had an effective CPM of $.071 on mobile and $0.19 on desktop in 2012.) However, Twitter is really selling its ads as a way for companies to engage with consumers, so the filing also notes trends in cost per ad engagement \u2014 basically, it\u2019s been falling steadily, with a sequential decrease of 46 percent in the last quarter, 12 percent the quarter before that, and 19 percent the quarter before that. (A decline in cost means Twitter is getting paid less for each engagement.) The filing attributes these declines to an increase in ad inventory, which has been partially offset by growing demand. Advertising also gets its own section (page 18 if you want to read along) in the filing\u2019s discussion of various risk factors, where Twitter notes that all kinds of things could go wrong with its ad programs \u2014 for example, if Twitter is unable to convince brands to invest in building a presence on the service, or if new programs like its video-based Amplify ads don\u2019t take off, or if the decline in cost per engagement continues. As we wrote earlier , Twitter brought in $253 million in revenue in the first six months of the year. Of that amount, $221 million (87 percent) came from ads, compared to $32 million (13 percent) from data licensing. In comparison, the company made $7 million from advertising in all of 2010 (that\u2019s when it launched its first ad programs) and $21 million from data licensing. Oh, and Twitter says that mobile accounts for 65 percent of its ad revenue .", "lede": "If\u00a0you\u2019re reading Twitter\u2019s S-1 filing to see where the business ...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/twitter-ad-numbers/"}, {"author": "Alex Wilhelm", "title": "Twitter's International Revenue Is Skyrocketing, But The Company Is Worried About Sina Weibo And Line", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:12:47", "content": "Twitter\u2019s international revenue is up massively year over year, with the company earning more in the first half of 2013 from outside the United States than it did in all of 2012. Twitter\u2019s full-year 2012 international revenue totaled $53 million, while its first two quarters of 2013 saw $62.8 million in international incomes. According to its S-1 filing , Twitter has sold its \u201cPromoted Products\u201d services in more than 20 countries. That implies that Twitter is able to monetize its service in more than its home market. Users around the world are therefore valuable to the company, and not merely to its usage statistics. International revenue is a growing percentage of its top line, growing from 17 percent of total incomes in 2012, to 25 percent in the first half of 2013. This is healthy for the firm, underlining that it retain revenue growth potential despite becoming an established company. Twitter, like Facebook, generates much of its revenue from mobile usage of its social product. The company, however, is direct that while mobile is currently a strength for it, rival services that are also strong on mobile could slow its growth in usage and revenue. Here\u2019s Twitter\u2019s S-1 name-checking a number of services that could harm its growth: [I]ncreased competition from local websites, mobile applications and services that provide real-time communications, such as Sina Weibo in China, LINE in Japan and Kakao in South Korea, which have expanded and may continue to expand their geographic footprint; If those services were to expand to as many markets as Twitter, they could lower Twitter\u2019s usage, and therefore its ability to sell advertisements. Twitter plans on selling advertisements in more countries in the future it states, but if Line and its ilk slow its rollout, Twitter could find its revenue growth on hold. Twitter is already a mobile company , and it is quickly becoming an international firm. Given strong smartphone penetration in Asia, this is not surprising.

People took that idea and strengthened it by using @names to have public conversations, #hashtags to organize movements, and Retweets to spread news around the world. Twitter represents a service shaped by the people, for the people.

The company is looking to raise $1 billion in this initial offering, which is set to mint many millionaires among shareholders and founders like Ev Williams, Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone. Currently, the filing does not list a valuation, and sources are saying that\u2019s because they have yet to determine one. Twitter\u2019s revenues have been revealed for the first time, as well. Revenues for 2012 were $316.9 million, for a loss of $79.4 million and in the first half of 2013 they\u2019ve already earned $253.6 million for a loss of $69.3 million. That\u2019s just above estimates from last year but well below tracking of over $600 million for the year. Overall, Twitter has lost $418.6 million since it began. Twitter will be offering up 472,613,753 shares of stock in this initial release. Twitter says that it currently has 218.3 million monthly active users, and those users have created over 300 billion tweets. That MAU number is significantly lower than many had expected at this point as they announced that they had 200 million MAUs in December. Twitter says that it delivers over 200 billion tweets per day. Twitter says that 75 percent of its MAUs access the service from mobile devices (that\u2019s 161.25 million) and that 65 percent of all of its ad revenues come from mobile. This marks a big contrast to Facebook, which had no revenues in mobile at all when it filed for IPO. Twitter says that in the second quarter of 2013 there were approximately 30 billion \u2018online impressions\u2019 of tweets off of its properties. The companies\u2019 current estimates put spam accounts at under 5 percent of MAUs, but says that this may not be accurate. On the employment front, Twitter says that it has gained over 900 employees in the year since June 2012, an increase of 90 percent. It currently employs over 2,000 people. Twitter\u2019s IPO has been a hotly anticipated event for some months now, with news of Twitter\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d filing coming via a tweet last month . The stealth filing was made possible by the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) act, which allows companies with less than $1 billion in revenue to file for an IPO without exposing the details immediately. Twitter lists a number of risk factors in the filing, noting that the business could be harmed if \u201cinfluential users, such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets and brands or certain age demographics\u201d conclude that an alternative product or service is more relevant; they are unable to convince potential new users of the value and usefulness of our products and services; or\u00a0they are unable to combat spam or other hostile or inappropriate usage on the platform.

That dual class structure effectively means that a small number of people can control a public company, even if they don\u2019t own a majority of the company\u2019s shares. You can argue the pros and cons of that structure , but it\u2019s quite common. And it\u2019s why people ranging from the Sulzberger family (New York Times) to Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) to Sergey Brin and Larry Page (Google) get to run what are in many ways private companies, even though their shares trade publicly: There\u2019s almost no chance an outsider can buy up shares and push them around. But Twitter, which is both a media and a tech company, isn\u2019t following in their footsteps. The company\u2019s S-1 notes that it has only one class of shares. So Dick Costolo and Evan Williams aren\u2019t given any special powers \u2014 their shares entitle them to the same voting power that your shares give you. The messaging here is clear: \u201cAt Twitter,\u201d the company\u2019s filing would like to say but can\u2019t because it can\u2019t actually speak, \u201cwe are way more responsive to shareholder interests than many of our peers.\u201d There\u2019s a caveat, of course: Twitter\u2019s board retains the right to issue preferred stock, which could indeed come with special voting rights and other powers.\u00a0It\u2019s the kind of thing you might see employed if a corporate raider like Carl Icahn ever showed up at the door with big ideas. But those shares don\u2019t exist yet, and Twitter said it doesn\u2019t have any plans to issue them. So for now, the company is an interesting anomaly.

Today, the social microblogging company that started out its life as another product altogether unveiled its S-1 documents for its public offering of $1 billion. Its symbol will be TWTR, but Twitter did not say where its stock would be traded. In its filing, the company went very cute, with an image of its first tweet by co-founder and Twitter creator Jack Dorsey, noting, \u201cTwitter was born on March 21, 2006 with just 24 characters.\u201d It also included images of tweets from everyone from President Barack Obama to Wheat Thins to the one from Clarence House announcing the new royal baby in England. More importantly, this is the first look at the business of the privately held San Francisco-based Twitter. Revenue for 2012 was $316.9 million. For the first half of 2013, $253.6 million. The company lost $79.4 million in 2012 and lost $69.3 million in the first half of 2013. But, on an adjusted basis, Twitter noted in its filing: \u201cFrom 2011 to 2012, revenue increased by 198% to $316.9 million, net loss decreased by 38% to $79.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 149% to $21.2 million. From the six months ended June 30, 2012 to the six months ended June 30, 2013, revenue increased by 107% to $253.6 million, net loss increased by 41% to $69.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $20.7 million to $21.4 million.\u201d In other words, it is slowly making money, at least from a cash flow perspective. Expectations of revenue were pegged at just about $600 million this year and close to $300 million last year. In the filing, Twitter said it had 215 million active users, or those that use the service at least once a month, sending out 500 million tweets daily. It said in December that it had 200 million. As of midyear, Twitter said it had $164.4 million in cash or cash equivalents. As to the big owners of Twitter, pre-IPO: CEO Dick Costolo with 7.6 million shares, co-founder and chairman Jack Dorsey with 23.4 million shares, co-founder and former CEO and director Evan Williams with 56.9 million shares. Director Peter Fenton held 31.6 million shares for Benchmark Capital. The other big holders, called \u201c5% Stockholders,\u201d include, as I had previously reported: Rizvi Traverse, Spark Capital, Benchmark, Union Square Partners and DST Global. Shares are expected to trade starting in November, which it can do after a 21-day period after the public filing. But it could also delay that, especially if markets suffer due to the recent government shutdown. Twitter is far along in the IPO process, having filed financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. It has since been going back and forth with regulators on issues, confidentially, part of a filing process for companies with revenue of less than $1 billion under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. It released news of the filing in September via \u2014 of course \u2014 a tweet. Twitter will now go on a public road show for investors, although it has been in talks with a number of them already as part of the process. Here are the bankers, for those who care about such things (only the bankers): Goldman Sachs in the lead, with Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as well as smaller players, Allen &amp; Co. and Code Advisors. Here is Twitter\u2019s inevitable tweet about the filing: Our S-1 will be filed publicly with the SEC momentarily. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale. \u2014 Twitter (@twitter) October 3, 2013 And, in its short letter to potential shareholders from @twitter, the company said: We started with a simple idea: share what you\u2019re doing, 140 characters at a time.

The company filed the official IPO documents several weeks ago under the new JOBS Act, which allows companies with a market value of less than $1 billion to keep their filing hidden from public view for at least three weeks. The company said it plans to raise a maximum of $1 billion in the offering, but didn\u2019t say which exchange it will be trading on. Twitter announced on September 12 that it had filed the S-1 with the SEC , but multiple reports said the filing was actually made much earlier, possibly as early as July. In a letter to shareholders, the company said: \u201cThe mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve\u2013and do not detract from\u2013a free and global conversation.\u201d According to the SEC filing, Twitter had $316 million in revenue last year or more than 10 times what it had in 2010. In the six months ended in June, it had revenue of $253 million, or more than twice what it had in the same period of 2012 \u2014 but it recorded a loss of $69 million. In 2012 it lost $49 million. The company said it had free cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $21 million in the first six months of this year. Market value expected to be $15B plus A number of observers speculated before the filing that Twitter could launch its public offering at between $28 and $30 a share , which would give the company a market value of more than $15 billion. Earlier this year, when Blackrock Ventures acquired shares from employees and early investors in a private transaction, the company was valued at about $9 billion \u2014 and in 2011, when Russian venture fund DST Global bought shares, it was valued at $8 billion. An IPO is expected to make several early investors and insiders billionaires, including former CEO Evan Williams and venture investor Chris Sacca. Some early venture groups could also wind up with stakes worth $1 billion or more, including Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital. Twitter has raised a little over $1 billion so far, with some of that being sales by employees and early backers. In the S-1, Twitter says $221 million of the total $253 million in revenue it brought in during the first half of this year came from advertising \u2014 the rest from data licensing. Earlier estimates from industry groups such as eMarketer had estimated that Twitter could make as much as $580 million this year from advertising, which is its main source of revenue. Under the \u201crisk factors\u201d category, Twitter said: \u201cTo the extent our user growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement and ad engagement on Twitter. If people do not perceive our products and services to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract users or increase the frequency of their engagement with our platform and the ads that we display.\u201d Over 215 million active users per month The SEC document says that Twitter has 215 million active users per month, and that 75 percent of them access the service on a mobile device. The company had previously said that it has about 200 million users, although there were no details provided previously about the number of active users, as opposed to dormant accounts. According to the S-1 the service has 100 million daily active users. Some have estimated that the number of fake or automated spam accounts could be as high as 10 percent of the overall number, but Twitter says it is actually 5 percent (although it admits this is an estimate based on a sample). Under risk factors, the S-1 says: \u201cWe anticipate that our user growth rate will slow over time as the size of our user base increases.\u201d Evan Williams According to the S-1 filing, co-founder Jack Dorsey owns just under 5 percent of the company, co-founder and former CEO Ev Williams owns 12 percent and current CEO Dick Costolo owns 1.6 percent. If the stock trades in the expected range of $28 to $30 per share, Williams\u2019s stake would be worth approximately $1.7 billion and Dorsey\u2019s would be worth $700 million. More than the number of users, Twitter\u2019s future rests on the amount of engagement it can show those users having with content from advertisers \u2014 and the data it can provide to those advertisers and partners such as TV networks. The company recently launched a feature called \u201cTwitter Amplify\u201d that allows it to target ads towards users who have been watching a specific TV show, and it has acquired a number of companies such as Bluefin that can crunch that data. One of the big question marks for Twitter is how much bottom-line value that kind of relationship can actually produce, and whether Facebook \u2014 which has also been making a similar pitch to TV networks and advertisers about its value as a social-sharing pipeline \u2014 will be able to steal some of its thunder .

The initial public offering marks the first time that Twitter has been required to make much of its financial data public, and it shows a company that is growing its revenue but still hasn't quite turned a profit. The SEC filing says that Twitter has 218 million monthly active users, up from 200 million in December 2012. The company also says it has seen a 198 percent growth in year-over-year revenue, bringing in $316.9 million in 2012, and a 38 percent decrease in net loss to $79.4 million. For the first half of 2013, the company brought in $253.6 million in revenue and its net loss was tallied at $69.3 million. AllThingsD reminds us that expectations for Twitter's revenues \u201cwere pegged at just about $600 million this year and close to $300 million last year.\u201d So Twitter's IPO will be small, at least compared to Facebook's recent IPO , in which the company said it expected to raise $13 billion on 337,415,352 shares of stock. But Facebook's shares stumbled quite a bit when the company finally got out on the track, with some investors claiming that the company had been overvalued. It has only relatively recently found its footing.

Eyeing a major growth of its office space, Twitter is in discussions with real-estate developer Shorenstein Properties to lease more than 300,000 square feet in a building that neighbors its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco's Mid-Market neighborhood near City Hall, according to multiple people briefed on the talks. No lease has been signed, and the landlord continues to talk to other potential tenants for the space in the 10-story building known as 1Tenth, the people said. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment. The discussions suggest an aggressive growth plan: The space would nearly double Twitter's existing footprint and could accommodate more than 2,000 additional employees\u2014roughly the size of its existing global workforce. The company first leased about 215,000 square feet at 1355 Market Street\u2014a former furniture mart built in the 1930s\u2014from Shorenstein in 2011. At the time, Twitter's lease was considered a path-breaking move for the gritty Mid-Market neighborhood. It subsequently moved into another 85,000 square feet in the building, and it has exercised options for additional space that would bring its total to about 400,000 square feet. City officials have tried for decades to spruce up the neighborhood, long populated by a large number of homeless people and payday loan shops. But Twitter's move in 2011 and incentives put in place by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee helped unleash a wave of tech-company migration to the area.

The IPO will initially seek to raise up to $1 billion. In its first public disclosure of financial performance, Twitter revealed it is growing revenue fast but losing money. In a registration filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, known as a \u201cform S-1,\u201d Twitter says its revenue increased to $316.9 million in 2012, from $106 million in 2011. Its net loss for 2012 was $79 million. In the first six months of this year, according to the filing, it pulled in $253.7 million in revenue, up from $122 million in the first six months of 2012. But its losses appear to be widening. The company lost $69 million in the first six months of this year, not far from its total loss for all of last year. The company said it had 218.3 million users per month, on average, for the three-month period ended in June. That\u2019s up from 85 million users per month in the same period last year. Before going public, the company must first wait through a three-week quiet period. After a \u201croad show\u201d that markets shares, Twitter and its underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs, will set a price for them. Twitter stock won\u2019t be available to the public, then, until November. Twitter had reportedly been planning to raise $1.5 billion with an offering of 50 million to 55 million shares priced at $28 to $30 each. Its 2013 revenue had been estimated at $545 million by eMarketer, set to rise to $807 million in 2014. Twitter said more than 65 percent of its advertising revenue came from mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. Because mobile advertising revenue is growing much more quickly than desktop advertising revenue in developed markets like the U.S., some believe Twitter has as a significant advantage over rivals like Facebook, which gleaned just 41 percent of ad revenue from mobile in its most recent quarter. Twitter\u2019s IPO filing marks its first release of revenue and profit figures, providing an unprecedented glimpse into the company\u2019s financial health and growth prospects. More broadly, the filing sets the tone for one of the most anticipated IPOs in the current tech boom, matched only by the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn. Enthusiasm for Twitter shares could encourage more tech companies to go public rather than wait or sell themselves to larger competitors. Among the companies rumored to be weighing an IPO this year are enterprise storage firm Box; big data outfit Palantir; payment provider Square, which shares co-founder Jack Dorsey with Twitter; marketing software company HubSpot; and discount retailer Gilt. Launched in 2006 as a way to circulate text messages among groups, Twitter quickly expanded beyond the California tech cognoscenti to become a global phenomenon, with everyone from Hollywood celebrities to world political leaders to political dissidents trading messages via the web, smartphone apps, and SMS messages. But Twitter repeatedly hit scaling and stability problems and was slow to monetize its popularity. That helps explain why Twitter\u2019s IPO will be much smaller than Facebook\u2019s $16 billion offering in May 2012. Twitter\u2019s lower revenue did help it in one regard: Since the company\u2019s annual sales are below $1 billion, it was able to submit a draft version of its S-1 to federal regulators back in July and was then presumably able to incorporate the feds\u2019 confidential feedback into the final S-1 filed today. Typically, draft filings and SEC feedback are submitted in full public view, but under the recently-enacted JOBS Act smaller companies like Twitter may keep the process private.", "lede": "Twitter has filed to go public, saying it will sell shares under ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/twitter-files-for-ipo-2/"}]}, {"cluster": 19, "articles": [{"author": "Catherine Shu", "title": "WeLend Brings Online Social Lending To Hong Kong", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:31:40", "content": "Founded by WeLab, a finance startup, WeLend is the first social lending platform based in Hong Kong. Since launching in early July, WeLab says it has received US$4 million in loan applications. The social, or peer-to-peer, lending industry in the U.S. has existed since 2006, when Prosper and Lending Club were both founded. In mainland China, prominent peer-to-peer lending platforms include Creditease , SinoLending and PPDai . Despite Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international financial center, however, there were no peer-to-peer lending platforms before WeLend launched. Simon Loong, the founder and CEO of WeLab, says the startup is currently focused on educating potential borrowers about WeLend\u2019s services. Loong hopes his fifteen years in the banking industry, including a position as North East Asia Regional Head of Unsecured Lending at Standard Chartered Bank, will help WeLend gain credibility and grow. Though informal lending clubs are common in Hong Kong, barriers to entry for peer-to-peer platforms include stringent financial regulations and competition from dominant players in the banking industry such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citicorp. \u201cIn the past when you resided in the same village, you\u2019d lend money to one another. That\u2019s the essential concept behind the peer-to-peer model,\u201d says Loong. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting fact that we hear often when we do user education. People say that their grandfather\u2019s generation did this in their village. Now we are looking at how we can scale that model by using our banking experience.\u201d \u00a0 WeLab holds a money lenders license in Hong Kong and currently only accepts loans from lenders in the company\u2019s private network. WeLend assesses potential borrowers based their credit rating, as well as information such as income, occupation and property ownership. To optimize returns on its portfolio, WeLend currently only approves 20% of loan applicants. Many of WeLend\u2019s applicants want to consolidate debt and the platform also targets small-to-medium businesses seeking to borrow money. Its typical loan amount is currently US$10,000 to US$20,000 for a 24-month term. Like Prosper and LendingClub, WeLend entices borrowers by offering lower interest rates than banks and other traditional financial institutions. The platform says its annual percentage rate (APR) ranges from 3% to 25%, compared to 7% to 35% offered by banks or 10% to 60% offered by consumer finance companies. Another attraction for borrowers is WeLend\u2019s one-day application process, compared to the five to seven days required by many banks. \u201cSo far we have US$4 million in loan applications, and momentum is good,\u201d says Loong. \u201cIt took us 45 days to reach the first million, and 15 days to get to the second million in applications.\u201d WeLab\u2019s next step is exploring how to scale up WeLend by understanding regulations and borrowing behaviors in different Asian countries. Loong says by targeting smaller, mature markets, WeLend has an advantage over peer-to-peer lending platforms in larger countries like U.S., China and UK. \u201cThere are few mature Asian markets and knowing how to do one market doesn\u2019t give you scalability. It\u2019s still a relatively new concept for the U.S., China and UK,\u201d says Loong. \u201cThey still have a long way to go domestically before international expansion, but we know the local, mature Asian markets.\u201d In addition to WeLend, WeLab will focus on building other online products that \u201cdemocratize finance.\u201d The startup has already raised a round of seed funding from private investors and is planning to raise a Series A in the first half of 2014. WeLab operates WeLend, Hong Kong\u2019s first peer-to-peer lending platform. Our ultimate goal is to provide people with the opportunity to borrow, invest, and connect through a secure, professional, and efficient platform. By removing expensive middlemen and other complexities from our business model, we make securing a personal loan easy and affordable.

It isn\u2019t clear exactly how the two operating systems would share the handset, in terms of allowing dual-booting or making a user choose a default at device setup, but it\u2019s a sign Redmond may be thinking about pulling out all the stops to get people using its mobile OS. These talks are in very early stages, according to Bloomberg\u2019s sources, and there\u2019s a possibility that Microsoft may even reduce or eliminate its licensing fee for Windows Phone to make it more attractive to HTC. HTC seems to be a target because it\u2019s a former partner that has already built both Windows and Android hardware (though it doesn\u2019t seem to be too keen on delivering more on the Windows Phone side). Microsoft\u2019s head of Operating Systems Terry Myerson is said to be heading to Taiwan to discuss the arrangement in further detail with HTC, says Bloomberg. There are a couple of reasons this makes sense, including some information TechCrunch has heard about Microsoft and its organizational sentiment towards Android. First, HTC has been one of Microsoft\u2019s few hardware partners for Windows Phone, and that relationship is likely strained given the Nokia hardware division purchase. Second, HTC is in a bad way in terms of continuing poor financial performance, and in terms of device sales, so it\u2019s probably very willing to consider unorthodox models to help it gain some unique appeal for users. As to what we\u2019ve heard about internal feelings on Android at Microsoft, a source suggests that there are contingents of younger engineers at the company who pushed hard to have Android/Windows dual-booting on Surface tablet devices, so there\u2019s a willingness to experiment with things very much like this HTC dual-OS smartphone. Those ideas, TechCrunch has been told, came from younger elements within Microsoft\u2019s mobile engineering team, and were not embraced by the older more established elements of senior management. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is leaving within the next year, he announced back in August, and there have been other big executive shifts at the company lately, too, including the departure of Xbox head Don Mattrick and Windows lead Steven Sinofsky. This may have changed the culture enough at Microsoft to allow some of the more radical new ideas to gain better purchase, which could result in an HTC device that lets users choose not one, but two mobile operating systems with one device buy.

As music streaming services around the world face down the international expansion of Spotify and Deezer , Dhingana CEO Rohit Bhatia says the startup is hedging its bets on a mobile-first strategy as well as growth in international markets. Over 75% of its users access its one-million song library from mobile devices, which the startup says marks a 200% growth year-over-year. Dhingana, which is based in Pune, India and Sunnyvale, Ca., says half of its monthly active users come from outside of India. The U.S. accounts for most of that number, with 2.5 million users, while 1 million access the service from Europe and the U.K. Within India, Dhingana\u2019s cross-platform strategy is tailored for the country\u2019s fragmented mobile marketplace, where featurephones still dominate but smartphone shipments are growing rapidly . According to Dhingana, its apps have been downloaded over 6 million times across Android, iOS, Windows 8, BlackBerry, Nokia and Amazon Kindle platforms. CEO Rohit Bhatia says Dhingana has achieve most of its growth from organic traffic and spends almost nothing on marketing. The service, however, faces several major competitors. Though Spotify and Deezer have not launched in India yet, both are focusing on international expansion \u00a0and India\u2019s fast-growing Internet user base presents an attractive opportunity.\u00a0Dhingana\u2019s main domestic competitors include Saavn and Gaana , both of which also want to leverage international growth. For example, Saavn, which\u00a0claimed 10 million monthly active visitors at the beginning of this year , is taking a double-pronged approach to user acquisition by offering an English-language service for foreign audiences with a taste for Bollywood music while building its catalog of Western tracks for Indian listeners. Gaana, a music streaming service backed by\u00a0 Times Internet , one of India\u2019s largest Internet companies,\u00a0 says international audiences make up a large part of its user base . Other Indian streaming music services include Raaga and MusicIndiaOnline.CO . Bhatia says Dhingana\u2019s competitive advantage is offering a vast array of music for every language and region in India with tracks in more than 42 languages and genres. \u201cIt took Dhingana almost over a year and a half to sign licensing agreements with 900-plus labels,\u201d says Bhatia. \u201cIf you want to be a truly Indian music streaming service, you have to sign up with all the regional labels, so it can be pretty time-consuming.\u201d Another advantage it has over international competitors such as Spotify is its network of micropayment methods, which is important because India has a credit card penetration rate of just 1.7% . Dhingana also hopes its mobile-first strategy will help it attract listeners. In addition to a mobile-optimized site, it also has Web apps for Opera and UC Browser, two of India\u2019s top mobile browsers. Once users switch to smartphones, Dhingana sends a push notification prompting them to download the app for their operating system. Bhatia says Dhingana also focuses on search-engine optimization so its Web site shows up near the top of search results for popular tracks. The service currently monetizes through ads and a premium subscription service called Dhingana Gold , which is in a in-app purchase through its free iOS app . The startup raised a Series B of $7 million in October 2012 from Lightspeed Venture Partners , with participation from previous investors\u00a0Inventus Capital Partners and Helion Venture Partners. Launch Date: 2007 Funding: $7M Dhingana is an Indian on-demand music service that wants its users to discover new traditional Indian and Bollywood music across the globe.

Being a communication backbone of the web has its pluses and minuses. Twitter gets lots of content syndicated from other sites, but those contributors don\u2019t necessarily visit Twitter or see its ads. That last part is a problem, especially since these blind tweeters count as some of Twitter\u2019s 218.3 million active users. Twitter explains on page 61 of its S-1 filing \u00a0that an \u201cactive user\u201d includes not only people that actually visit its site and mobile apps, but also \u201cTwitter users who logged in and accessed Twitter through\u2026registered third-party applications or websites.\u201d Those users do push content to Twitter that draws people to its feed where it shows ads, so they help the site monetize. But they also aren\u2019t seeing ads themselves. There are tons of ways to syndicate to Twitter. People auto-tweet their blog posts, Tumblr updates and even their Facebook posts. IFTTT and other automation services make this easy. In its pre-monetization phase, getting more content may have been the right bet, and still may be, but it could make Twitter seem larger than it is. \u201cI don\u2019t really go on Twitter anymore but I share my Instagrams there,\u201d a friend told me today. These Insta-pushers are even worse for Twitter than non-visiting contributors from elsewhere, because Instagram pulled support for Twitter Cards. That means rather than lingering on Twitter and viewing Instagrams in-line, people are whisked to Instagram\u2019s website\u2026where they don\u2019t see Twitter ads. My friend is not alone, considering that Twitter listed \u201cthe degree to which users access Twitter content through applications that do not contain our ads\u201d as one of its risks.\u00a0Yet it doesn\u2019t break out users who actually visit its feed from those who don\u2019t.

But its newest market is a little closer to home: Beginning Friday evening, riders in certain parts of Silicon Valley will be able to start requesting rides. Lyft, of course, is incredibly popular in its home market of San Francisco, where it launched and where it\u2019s been operating for the past year and a half. As a result, it\u2019s not surprising to see the company extend the service farther south. After all, with so many people in SF working on the peninsula \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 there was likely a number of people who were able to use Lyft in one place who wished to use it in the other. The launch, which happens tomorrow evening, will expand availability in the South Bay but it won\u2019t totally cover the area. Lyft\u2019s Silicon Valley service stretches from Menlo Park down to San Jose, but at launch it won\u2019t accept rides between the San Francisco city limits and, say, Redwood City. (It will drop off in those areas, so long as the ride originates in SF or farther south in Silicon Valley.) According to Lyft CEO Logan Green, the company is taking the same approach that it took in Los Angeles, its second market. With that launch, the ride-sharing service made itself available in just one specific part of the wide sprawl of the city: Santa Monica and Venice. Later, it expanded to other parts of the city as it felt comfortable with its ability to serve each new neighborhood. In the same way, Lyft decided to light up the \u201cdensest, most-active swath\u201d of the Silicon Valley market and make sure it could provide an adequate level of service there before expanding. It will close the gap between SF and Menlo Park over time \u2014 and eventually, it will likely expand into Oakland and the East Bay to serve the entire \u201cSan Francisco Bay Area.\u201d Lyft expects to see other similarities between Silicon Valley and L.A., like a longer average trip length. Green said that the average trip in cities like San Francisco tends to be about two miles, while in the suburbs you\u2019ll see it be more like four or five miles. But traffic is usually less intense than in the center of major cities. According to Green, Silicon Valley pricing per mile will be tuned down slightly from what San Francisco riders can expect to account for the longer average trip length and less traffic. Green says that Lyft is ramped up for a bigger launch than normal, but that the company expects to be able to meet Silicon Valley demand. In part, that\u2019s because a lot more people in Silicon Valley have cars than those in San Francisco. For a ride-sharing company, one of the advantages of operating in more suburban markets is that the number of potential drivers is a lot higher than in cities where everyone takes public transportation. Lyft has raised $82 million from investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Mayfield Fund, K9 Ventures, and Floodgate.

The company raised $1.16 billion prior to its planned initial public offering , which could total $1 billion itself. Here\u2019s another figure: Twitter\u2019s accumulated deficit to date is $418.6 million, a figure that will race to $748.2 million once it goes public and realizes\u00a0$329.6 million in costs related to\u00a0stock-based compensation expenses. This is not to say that Twitter has spent $418.6 million to date; that figure is far higher. Accumulated deficit can be viewed as the company\u2019s net income, net loss and paid dividends added together as debits and credits. So the formula is net income, minus net loss, minus paid dividends. Twitter pays no dividends, so its accumulated deficit is simply the amount of money that it has spent\u00a0 more than it has brought in as revenue in its life. In a simple way, it\u2019s the money that Twitter had to raise to keep its lights on during its growth. The company continues to lose money on a GAAP basis, and even on an adjusted net loss scale. So we can expect that Twitter\u2019s accumulated deficit will increase in time. The company doesn\u2019t appear to be operating in a way that would place it on a quick ramp to profitability, its loss rising year over year when the first half of 2013 is compared to the similar period in 2012. Twitter is not alone in having a large accumulated deficit. In 2005, for example, Amazon reported a $2.2 billion accumulated loss . That was a full decade after its birth and eight years after its initial public offering.\u00a0Trulia, by way of another comparison, had an accumulated deficit of $44 million before it went public. If Twitter raised more than $1 billion, but has an accumulated deficit of just $418.6 million, where did the rest of the money go? It still has quite a lot of it left, with cash on hand of $164.5 million and short-term investments of $210.5 million.\u00a0Twitter is about to become far more cash rich, following its offering, but not profitable.

The Venue 8 Pro is unexpectedly light, too, as it weighs a relatively scant .87 pounds \u2014 that\u2019s well within striking distance of the iPad mini. That said, the Venue 8 Pro suffers from a distinct lack of style. It\u2019s perhaps to be expected considering that this is Dell\u2019s first attempt at bringing a full-on Windows 8 experience to a device like this, and there\u2019s a lot that could go wrong with this sort of endeavor. Take the screen, for instance. One of my favorite reviews ever written features Paul Thurrott just eviscerating Acer\u2019s Windows 8-powered Iconia W3 tablet for its godawful screen. Some may say he was too heavy-handed in his criticism, but when the primary means of consuming and interacting with your content just sucks, something is very very wrong. Thankfully, early stinkers like the Acer make Dell\u2019s approach seem all the more palatable. The Pro\u2019s IPS screen \u2014 which ran at 1280 x 800 \u2014 was bright and well-saturated, and viewing angles seemed more than respectable during the brief moments I spent playing with the thing. Of course, the screen\u2019s size poses some issues. There\u2019s no denying that parts of Windows 8.1 just aren\u2019t suited for such small displays. The classic desktop mode is cramped and festooned with tiny icons that require a fair amount of dexterity to poke at accurately. Dell plans to downplay some of those issues by selling an active stylus that allows for precise manipulation of screen elements \u2014 I took that thing for a spin too and came away impressed. Part of the stylus\u2019s appeal is because Dell fought the urge to make it small enough to slot into the Venue\u2019s chassis. Instead the company opted to make a full-sized pen, which helps dramatically with usability (though you\u2019ll have to tuck it into a case or a pocket). And then there\u2019s longevity to consider. I\u2019m told that the battery is slated to last between 8 and 10 hours of normal use (whatever that is). That wouldn\u2019t amount to much if this thing wound up trading off performance for power, but the whole package seemed suitably snappy thanks to its 1.8GHz quad-core Intel Bay Trail chipset. We\u2019ll see if that remains the case once the final devices start trickling out into the wild. After being let down in such a big way by Microsoft\u2019s original Surface RT, I thought I\u2019d never splurge on a Windows tablet again. Now, after having played with Dell\u2019s attempt, I find myself rethinking my earlier position. The prospect of running full Windows apps on a device this light and this cheap is a terribly attractive one, and at this moment Dell\u2019s tiny tab seems well-equipped to take on what few Windows competitors are playing at this size. I may even buy this thing over the iPad mini, which is yet another thing I never thought I\u2019d say. Stay tuned for the full review in short order.

As with every S-1 filing, the company reports which individuals/firms hold the most shares in the company. According to this table , founder Evan Williams owns 12 percent of the company before the offering. Benchmark and the firm\u2019s partner and board member Peter Fenton owns 6.7 percent. Fellow founder Jack Dorsey owns 4.9 percent and CEO Dick Costolo owns 1.6 percent. Other stock holders that own 5 percent or more of the company include Rizvi Traverse (which is reportedly backed by Chris Sacca ), Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and DST. It\u2019s not clear how much each investor owns specifically. Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital were Twitter\u2019s earliest institutional investors (USV led the company\u2019s first major round, and Spark Capital led Twitter\u2019s second round), as was Charles River Ventures, who is not listed in the table and put in around $250,000 early on. Benchmark came in at Twitter\u2019s Series C funding. We\u2019re hearing from a source that Rizvi could own as much as 15 percent of the company. We\u2019re also hearing that after Rizvi, Williams is the next largest single shareholder followed by Benchmark, Spark, USV and then DST. Spark originally owned around 15 percent, as well but sold some of the stake to Rizvi. Other large employee (or former employee) shareholders that were not listed in the table include founder Biz Stone, COO Ali Rowghani, and former General Counsel Alex Macgillivray. Other things to note from the chart: revenue chief Adam Bain holds less than 1 percent of the company, as do board members Peter Curie, and David Rosenblatt. It appears that other board member Peter Chernin\u2019s shares have not vested. In terms of salary, Costolo made $200,000 per year (but this was dropped to $14,000 in August of this year); Bain makes $200,000, and SVP of engineering Christopher Fry earn $145,513 yearly.

In the S-1 form that the company filed today for its public offering, Twitter called mobile the \u201cprimary driver of our business.\u201d It said that 75% of its 218.3 million+ monthly active users are accessing the site from mobile devices \u2014 or 161.25 million users. And mobile accounts for 65% of all its ad revenues. All in all, the word \u201cmobile\u201d comes up 130 times in the 160+ page document. From the intro to the filing: Mobile has become the primary driver of our business. Our mobile products are critical to the value we create for our users, and they enable our users to create, distribute and discover content in the moment and on-the-go. The 140 character constraint of a Tweet emanates from our origins as an SMS-based messaging system, and we leverage this simplicity to develop products that seamlessly bridge our user experience across all devices. In the three months ended June 30, 2013, 75% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device, including mobile phones and tablets, and over 65% of our advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. We expect that the proportion of active users on, and advertising revenue generated from, mobile devices, will continue to grow in the near term. If you recall, when Facebook filed its S-1 before going public, the company had no revenues in mobile and made a big point of spelling that out, with 425 million of its 845 million monthly active users accessing the service from mobile devices (those are from the initial S-1, which got revised up several times before the company finally listed). Twitter is in a significantly different position. Not only does the company have a majority of its users accessing from mobile devices, but it already make a majority of its ad revenues from these platforms. (The main ad unit currently on Android and iOS, Promoted Products, was introduced in February 2012.) While there have been a lot of changes to the basic desktop product over the last couple of years, in 2013 you could argue that the biggest product moves that Twitter has made have been in mobile, from the launch of the Vine video app (to follow through on the photo filters that it launched near the end of 2012) through to its experiments with Twitter Music (also a mobile app), and its acquisition of MoPub (a specialist in mobile ad-tech). Twitter pretty much says it all about mobile and its ambitions to push the envelope in that area, in a bit of very typical S-1 jargon: \u201cIf new or enhanced products or services fail to engage users and advertisers, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue or operating profit to justify our investments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\u201d With 130 mentions of mobile in the S-1, here are a few of the interesting points that jumped out at me in a first reading: \u2013 The big threat in mobile for Twitter is in Asia . Specifically, it pinpoints the rise of multiple local messaging apps. \u201cIncreased competition from local websites, mobile applications and services that provide real-time communications, such as Sina Weibo in China, LINE in Japan and Kakao in South Korea, which have expanded and may continue to expand their geographic footprint,\u201d it writes. \u2013 Mobile can be misleading . \u201cOur metrics are also affected by mobile applications that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved, and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs.\u201d \u2013 Mobile growth . The 75% MAU number is from the end of June 2013; a year before that it was 66%. \u2013 Mobile and user engagement . Twitter makes its most clearest statements in here for why it is that it makes new products for mobile. \u201cOur most engaged users are generally those who access Twitter via our mobile applications,\u201d it notes. \u201cIn the three months ended June 30, 2013, a substantial majority of timeline views were on mobile devices, and the increase in timeline views was driven by mobile user engagement\u2026we plan to continue to develop and improve our mobile applications to further drive user adoption.\u201d", "lede": "Twitter started on mobile, and that\u2019s where the service is going....", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/mobile-twitter-161m-access-from-handheld-devices-each-month-65-of-ad-revenues-coming-from-mobile/"}, {"author": "Aaron Souppouris", "title": "The voice of Siri is Susan Bennett", "feed_title": "The Verge -  All Posts", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:08:07", "content": "\" I'm the original voice of Siri .\" That's the quote CNN attributes to Susan Bennett, a voice talent that says her voice was used for Apple's virtual assistant. \"I wasn't sure that I wanted the notoriety,\" Bennett tells CNN, explaining her delay in coming forward, \"and I also wasn't sure where I stood legally.\" In fact, it was\u00a0 The Verge 's article on synthesized speech that prompted her to come forward. &#13; CNN notes that the article, which looks at how synthetic voices are created, led some to believe Allison Dufty, a voice talent who was recorded at the same GM Voices Atlanta facility as Bennett, was the voice of Siri. \"I was conservative about it for a long time... then this Verge video came out... and it seems like everyone was clamoring to find out who the real voice behind Siri is, and so I thought, well, you know, what the heck?

While mobile still represents a seemingly small percentage of overall revenue \u2014 generally between two percent and 10 percent depending on the business \u2014 the growth rate is impossible to deny. A recent study by IBM found that mobile commerce grew by 31 percent in Q1 of 2013, outpacing all e-commerce at 20 percent and in-store at 3.7 percent. Any statistician will tell you that percentages are only as good as their perspective size, coercing many marketing strategies to focus on other \u201cchannels.\u201d However \u2014 to be blunt \u2014 mobile is not a channel. It begins, reinforces and sometimes completes all channels. By not understanding the influence that mobile devices exert in all revenue centers, any company is susceptible to losing revenue at 25 times that of direct mobile revenue. Applying research from a March 2013 Deloitte study , mobile can influence traditional in-store purchases by an astounding 17x. In addition, BloomReach\u2019s internal data anonymously connecting mobile and Web usage on the same merchant shows that mobile can influence a desktop e-commerce channel by up to 7x. So, hypothetically, a company that loses $10 million in yearly mobile revenue that provides poor mobile experiences stands to lose $70 million from desktop revenue and an additional $170 million from in-store purchases \u2014 totaling a whopping $250 million. Think it\u2019s not possible? Well, a recent Harris poll found that 90 percent of consumers think negatively of a brand if they have poorly performing mobile experiences, and Google found that 61 percent of consumers will leave a mobile site immediately if they don\u2019t find what they want right away. While many companies have responded with a mobile \u201cskin\u201d around traditional websites using responsive design or mobile proxy solutions, consumers want more relevant, more intuitive content in less time. Each situation is obviously unique, but below I\u2019ll discuss five elements to consider and understand when taking a mobile-centric view of brand-to-consumer experiences.

Constantly tethered to your side, they help you compare prices, find brick-and-mortar locations or see what your friends are interested in buying. Thus, understanding traffic origin can provide you with distinct clues behind the nature of a shopper. For example, analyzing metrics like time-on-site, bounce rates and number of pages discovered from each channel (even while in-store) can intuitively advise you about the best content and site navigation to provide. You have a data problem, not a design problem What good is a beautiful mobile site when product discovery is frustrating, causing visitors to leave in aggravation? It sounds obvious, but that\u2019s one of the top frustrations that lead to lost sales and negative brand associations on mobile sites. Companies have invested thousands into building gorgeous imagery, social features and catchy copy, but mobile sites ultimately boil down to utility and relevance. In a perfect world, we could just access a Siri-like interface that easily interprets our language and automatically determines our intentions, returning appropriate results and suggestions that fit our patterns and past behavior. While I\u2019m speaking somewhat futuristically, the underlying point is the same. Being able to collect, correctly predict and intuitively respond to the data/signals provided by shoppers is key to maximizing conversions. If done well, shopping on a mobile device can feel like browsing through a brick-and-mortar store with a personal shopper helping you to get closer and closer to the perfect product. Conversely, if the data is poor or incorrectly interpreted, then shoppers can be left with a frustrating series of dead-end searches and irrelevant products. For example, just because a visitor\u2019s time-on-site is high doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re satisfied. They could be aimlessly bouncing from page to page through category hierarchies \u2014 a common characteristic of infrastructures built for desktops a decade ago. Email is mobile American Eagle Outfitters recently cited that 70 percent of its loyalty emails are opened on a mobile device. While optimizing emails to be viewed on a smartphone may be a no-brainer, it\u2019s more important to correlate the mobile-site experience when they click through. A landing page should be consistent with the email look, feel, content and offer. With what content did they engage, and are there easily accessible links to other elements of the email offer? We are bombarded by marketing emails daily, so unlike other channels, consumers give very valuable insight simply because they are inspired by the subject line. Even if they ultimately don\u2019t access content directly in-line with the ever-important subject line , providing a dynamic experience that promotes effortless discovery of the intended purpose gives invaluable information \u2014 which includes engaging a loyal mobile shopper after the first landing page. However, one thing is certain. With email click-through rates hovering around 4.5 percent , one or two bad landing pages following an email click-through will leave you in the other 94.5 percent or completely opted-out. Location, location, location Store locators are still one of the top reasons that consumers visit mobile sites. However, it\u2019s important to remember that shoppers use their smartphones at every step on the path to purchase, including in a physical location. A retailer must connect users\u2019 location-based signals with items in stock and correct prices. There is nothing more frustrating than finding the perfect product on sale in the right size only to find out that the item is out of stock at the desired location. This makes real-time data integration extremely important. Consumers don\u2019t care if a company \u201cjust ran out\u201d or is \u201cexpecting a shipment.\u201d And, if a mobile shopper is looking at a product page (especially on an in-store Wi-Fi network, which 36.5 percent use to connect to that same store\u2019s website \u2014 the No. 1 mobile destination for the in-store shopper), help them find out where they can buy it right away or provide an expected delivery time, if absolutely necessary. Checkout While mobile commerce has seen tremendous growth, consumers are still extremely uncomfortable with whipping out a credit card while on the go. Clumsy fingers and security concerns severely limit the full revenue potential. As much as 90 percent of consumers don\u2019t log into a brand\u2019s sites (mobile or Web), so checkout should be convenient and fully functioning (e.g., avoid too many pop-up steps or unclear completion notices), without scary and invasive tactics. Consider having simple integrations with a device\u2019s email or social-messaging functions where a consumer can be reminded about intended purchases or liked items. Plus, it\u2019s a good way to combine past behavioral data to make enhanced and deeper product discovery more relevant. These are just five of the top things to consider and constantly improve. But the types of available data, ways to slice it and methods to act upon it far exceed where responsive design or mobile-commerce platforms have taken the mobile-commerce industry thus far. It was a good place to start, but it has become more the norm rather than the solution. The differentiating factors lie in the data a brand can crunch and integrate externally, in concert with internal data across channels. In the end \u2014 at least to this point \u2014 mobile is the connective tissue that binds together all marketing efforts, and can make or break any initiative. With giants like Amazon and Walmart Labs investing billions on technology to churn through terabytes of data where every nuance of consumer experience is optimized, developing data-driven strategies that are mobile-centric provides the best chance for survival.

But he\u2019s not making a CEO salary. In August, Costolo reduced his annual take-home compensation to a mere $14,000 annually, down from the $200,000 yearly comp that he and president of global revenue Adam Bain each received in 2012. While it may be more than the $1 a year salary that Mark Zuckerberg gives himself, it\u2019s no fat monthly paycheck. (And perhaps it\u2019s a nod to Twitter\u2019s famous tweet character limit of 140 characters.) Granted, there\u2019s one big caveat: Costolo is taking most of his pay in Twitter shares. Last year Costolo made $11.5 million, most of which came from stock and option awards. Costolo has also sold some shares. Along with chairman Jack Dorsey and COO Ali Rowghani, he sold some stock in 2011 to Yuri Milner\u2019s DST Global and investor Rizvi Traverse. Worth noting: Of the three highest-paid people on Twitter\u2019s executive compensation table, one in particular stands out. Christopher Fry, Twitter\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, made $10.34 million in 2012 (again, almost entirely from stock awards) \u2014 apparently more than CTO Adam Messinger, CFO Mike Gupta and COO Rowghani. As I noted in March, Messinger poached Fry from Salesforce back in 2012 , originally to work on infrastructure. But eventually, Fry made his way to working on consumer applications. Perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s considered so important \u2014 at least in terms of salary.

But Williams and Stone have moved on. And under current CEO Dick Costolo, Twitter has very quickly become an advertising company. Twitter only formally started selling ads in April 2010 , about six months after Costolo joined the company, originally as chief operating officer. But those were basically tests, and Twitter only generated $7.3 million in ad revenue that year. The next year, that number leapt to $77.7 million, and last year Twitter\u2019s ad salesforce generated $269.4 million. This year, the company may come close to doubling last year\u2019s number: In the first half of 2013, Twitter sold more than $221 million worth of ads. (Click chart to enlarge.) That\u2019s a very nice-looking ramp, and that\u2019s very much part of a plan. Twitter\u2019s sales team, lead by chief revenue officer Adam Bain, has argued for a while that it could have made more money, earlier, but that it wanted to bring in advertisers slowly \u2014 both because the company needed to make sure it had stuff it could sell them, and also because they wanted a nice-looking ramp. So mission accomplished, optically: With an eye on Facebook\u2019s struggles in the last couple years, Twitter has also made a point of noting that the service is in large part a mobile service, and that its ads have always worked for mobile users. In the second quarter of this year, Twitter notes, 65 percent of its ad revenue came from Apple iOS and Google Android devices.

The company reported more than 215 million monthly active users in its S-1 Filing on Thursday. At the bare minimum, that means that as of June 30, the company has added on average only 15 million monthly active users since the company hit more than 200 million late last year. What\u2019s unclear, at least from the language in this filing, is today\u2019s number for MAUs. As AllThingsD reported last month, sources indicated that Twitter had averaged in the range of 230 million to 240 million monthly active users just recently. That number, according to sources, could be closer to what Twitter\u2019s actual MAU number is today. Regardless: Stack that up against Facebook\u2019s 815 million monthly active users the company had at the time of its S-1 filing , and it\u2019s clear: Twitter is big, but it\u2019s no social behemoth. Twitter drills down a little bit more on a few other areas: The company sees more than 100 million daily active users, and 75 percent of those access the site from a mobile device. That could be a bright spot for potential investors, who have recently grown more confident in Internet companies\u2019 ability to monetize mobile platforms. On the one hand, Twitter hopes to jumpstart growth in a few ways over the coming months; the company has sent some of its top chiefs abroad to expand international efforts , Twitter\u2019s highest expected areas of growth in the future, according to the S-1. And the company also has a massive redesign in the works to its iOS application , with Android and other mobile platforms likely to follow. That new look could court more mainstream users who have often found the service difficult to crack \u2014 or at least tough to keep coming back to. Of course, there\u2019s a caveat here, too. Twitter just bought MoPub, a mobile advertising platform considered one of the most powerful and effective in the industry. As the S-1 notes, Twitter doesn\u2019t just plan to integrate MoPub\u2019s technology into the existing Twitter advertising platform. Twitter also plans \u201cto grow MoPub\u2019s current business, including by extending advertising across the mobile ecosystem through the MoPub exchange.\u201d In other words, Twitter can still make money by helping other people buy ads \u2014 even if they aren\u2019t Twitter ads. The numbers speak for themselves. Twitter may aim to be the global town square \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly not an overcrowded one. RELATED POSTS:", "lede": "Twitter has a growth problem.

That didn\u2019t happen overnight. The Chinese Internet giant has methodically leapt from online era to era since being founded in 1998, according to company president Martin Lau. Tencent President Martin Lau For instance, a few years ago, Tencent completely reorganized around what was coming next \u2014 moving more than half of its 20,000 employees to focus on mobile, Lau said today at the China 2.0 conference at Stanford University. One of the main results of that effort was the mobile messaging product Weixin. It worked. Weixin had 236 million monthly active users as of this summer, Lau said. But Weixin is part of a larger library of products: QQ instant messenger has 818 million monthly active users, Tencent mail has 274 million, and Tencent Weibo microblogging has 220 monthly active users. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018You have a hodgepodge of different services, so what is the core?\u2019\u201d Lau said. \u201cThe core, I would say, is the comprehensive social infrastructure. At core, we are a social company.\u201d Sure, it might be more convenient for Tencent to have one service to rule them all, Lau admitted. But the portfolio of products emerged over the years, rather than arriving as a fully formed unit. \u201cAll these services came at a different time,\u201d he said. \u201c[Tencent's social network] Qzone came when asynchronous chat became possible. Weixin came when we saw a big wave of mobile Internet coming.\u201d At this point, it would be technically difficult to combine everything and make it all compatible, Lau said \u2014 but Tencent does try to provide a common ID system and a common monetization back end. Tencent had $4.5 billion in revenue in the first half of 2013. Where did it come from? Not advertising, like U.S.-based social networks. Only nine percent of Tencent revenue is based on ads. Seventy percent of revenue comes from user payments, for example for virtual goods, including 53 percent from games. And the rest comes from commerce, Lau said. Focusing on mobile hasn\u2019t paid off yet in revenue, Lau admitted. He cited growth in mobile advertising from Facebook and Twitter, but said that was less applicable for Tencent properties. Lau said he expects that eventually \u201cthe real value is the connection of the phone with businesses offline.\u201d To that end, Tencent has a very active platform for outside developers, with 400,000 registered apps and $500,000 worth of revenue shared with partners so far, Lau said. Many of those are game developers, but they also include Chinese equivalents of Uber, which are shaking up the local taxi industry, and are built within Weixin. What\u2019s next for Tencent is international expansion, and it\u2019s clear that the company is still figuring out how to do that, through a combination of investments and partnerships (mostly in games, but also in things like Fab.com ) and its own product development. For instance, Tencent built an international version of the Weixin mobile messaging app called WeChat, with slightly different code. Lau said WeChat has 100 million registered accounts. (We should flag that this is different from the other stats, as it\u2019s not active users.) How will Tencent break into the U.S.? That question seemed to flummox Lau a bit. It\u2019s clearly a pressing challenge, with no obvious answer. \u201cU.S.\u00a0is a very tough market, U.S. is about the toughest,\u201d Lau said. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0the source of innovation in the Internet industry. You have your free SMS which takes away the cost appeal of microchat. You have iMessage \u2026\u00a0We will try to find ways to provide differentiated services.\u201d For now, Lau said, WeChat is seeing great traction in Southeast Asia.", "lede": "Tencent\u2019s market cap passed $100 billion a few weeks ago.

Other specs that are the same across the three are a microUSB port, a 3.5mm headset jack, a microSD card slot, a mini HDMI output and a 2-megapixel rear camera. As is often the case with Archos, the prices are very competitive: the 8-inch model will retail for $199.99, the 9.7-inch for $269.99 and the 10.1-inch model for $299.99.

It's also quite a reversal from earlier this year, when Rogers celebrated the Z10's arrival as the most successful BlackBerry launch in the carrier's history.

Previewed in June 2013 (see BIMMERPOST preview video below) and intended for off-road use only, the BMW M Laptimer App records data from a BMW Apps\u2013equipped vehicle's on-board network and GPS receiver to create comparative track sessions and provide essential performance information. It generates track maps and captures essential driving data including top speed, number of laps, best lap time and ambient temperature. Information is then presented on the scorecard screen when the vehicle is no longer in motion. The BMW M Laptimer provides highly visual depictions of throttle, speed, brake input, engine RPM, fuel level, and g-force. Users can easily zoom in and out, and rewind or fast forward through track recordings. BMW M Laptimer will automatically calculate laps and times for the user without the need for pre-installed track map data. The App can be used on virtually any closed circuit. A Comparison Mode gives users the ability to view individual or dual runs in real-time. Users can select their own laps or compare against a lap sent by another BMW driver. Users may also share track day results with friends to compare data. Additionally, users can post results through social media integration, including Facebook and Twitter.", "lede": "BMW Launches the BMW M Laptimer App Precise, real-time racing-sty...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/bmw-m-laptimer-goes-live-in-ios-app-store/"}, {"author": "Timothy J.

With the IPO, Twitter is looking to raise $1 billion on 472,613,753 shares of common stock, trading under the stock symbol TWTR. In the filing, the company also confirmed that it now has 218.3 million monthly active users (or MAUs) according to its most recent numbers, and that it pulled in $253.6 million in revenue for the six months ending June 30th, 2013, an increase of 107 percent from a year earlier. According to the company, mobile users unsurprisingly account for a particularly big chunk of its business, with 75 percent of its average MAUs accessing Twitter from a mobile device in the three months ending June 30, 2013, and mobile use accounting for 65 percent of its advertising revenue. It still isn't making a profit, though, with the company seeing a net loss of $69.3 million for the aforementioned six month period. That's compared to $316.9 million in revenue for all of 2012, and a net loss of $79.4 million. Of those 215 million MAUs, 49.2 million are in the United States, while 169.1 million are international, representing an increase of 35% and 47%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Beyond those numbers, the company has also revealed the number of Timeline views for the first time; they stood at 150.9 billion for the three months ending June 30th, and 287.2 billion for six months prior (up 69% and 79% from a year earlier). On average, that translates to 691 timeline views per MAU for the same three month period, although that number jumps a fair bit looking just at US Twitter users -- they rack up 825 timeline views on average. In a brief letter to shareholders included in the filing, the company says \"Twitter represents a service shaped by the people, for the people,\" and that \"the mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers,\" adding, \"our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve\u2013and do not detract from\u2013a free and global conversation.\" Those interested in digging into all of the numbers can find the full filing on the SEC's website . &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;", "lede": "&#13; Less than a month after announcing its plans for an IPO, Tw...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/twitter-ipo-stock-public-offering-shares/"}, {"author": "Brian Heater", "title": "Peripheral Vision 006: Shawn Campbell on starting a radio station with a computer and microphone", "feed_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 20:18:00", "content": "&#13; \"People sometimes say, 'oh, you're just like a real radio station,' \" Shawn Campbell begins with a smile. \"I have to say, 'we are a real radio station -- we're just one that doesn't have a broadcast signal yet.' \" Campbell is seated besides a mic in studio B of what does, indeed, look like a real radio station. I might have half-jokingly made a comment along those lines when we arrived -- one-hundred-plus years of terrestrial broadcasting is enough to instill one with certain preconceived notions about what, precisely, makes a radio station. Campbell launched Chicago-based CHIRP in 2007 with terrestrial radio dreams and a team of 75 volunteers. \"I'd had a couple of bad experiences in radio where I'd really poured my heart and soul into a station, only to have it thwarted by the owners,\" she explains. \"Initially we thought that we were going to have to wait to apply for a low-power FM federal broadcast license. We thought we were going to have to lobby and change the laws to be able to do that. But we were so engaged that after about six months, we thought there [was] no reason not to start as an online station and continue our work to increase access for low-power FM and eventually apply for a license.\" &#13; Perceived dial congestion has made it all but impossible for potential low-power stations to secure themselves a spot on the airwaves in a city like Chicago. Through the great democratizing of the internet, however, the CHIRP team has been able to realize many of its community-organized radio ambitions. \"It's pretty cheap and it's really easy,\" Campbell says. \"You don't have to be super tech savvy to start. You can grow it as you go, you can get a mixer, a turntable. But basically, if you have a computer and a microphone, that's all it takes to get started.\" Check out all of our Peripheral Vision Episodes: &#13; &#13;", "lede": "&#13; \"People sometimes say, 'oh, you're just like a real radio s...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/peripheral-vision-006/"}, {"author": "Brian Heater", "title": "The Engadget Podcast is live at 3:30PM ET!", "feed_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 20:00:00", "content": "&#13; We're back with Brian, Peter and Terrence in a new (if vaguely familiar) studio.

Naturally, Twitter expects both of cost of revenue and R&amp;D costs to rise year over year, although they will vary as a percentage of the company\u2019s total revenue. By way of comparison, Facebook\u2019s cost of revenue for the year\u2019s first six months was $878 million and it spent $637 million on R&amp;D. It spent $595 million on infrastructure during that time period. Facebook also brought in more than $3.2 billion in revenue during that timeframe, so its costs were considerably less as a percentage of total revenue. If there\u2019s anything to take away from this comparison, it might be that no matter your business, being a mega web company means spending a lot of money on engineers who can build cutting-edge products and software to run them on. And Twitter\u2019s engineers are keeping plenty busy .\u00a0Perhaps because of the nature of its business (which is to say it doesn\u2019t store untold petabytes of photos ), Twitter is still able to lease data center space, although its costs to run them might go down in the long term if were it to build its own like Facebook has done.", "lede": "Twitter doesn\u2019t have nearly the scalability concerns of its web p...", "link": "http://gigaom.com/2013/10/03/twitter-is-spending-more-and-less-on-tech-than-you-might-think/"}, {"author": "Ki Mae Heussner", "title": "Want to see Google Glass at work in the hospital?

He just thinks his work is more useful \u2014 and he\u2019s going to share his code with anyone who wants to see it. Along with a team of Stanford researchers that includes machine learning expert and Coursera co-founder Andrew Ng , Socher has developed a computer model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a sentence 85 percent of the time.\u00a0The previous state of the art for this task \u2014 essentially, discerning whether the overall tone of a sentence is positive or negative \u2014 peaked at about 80 percent accuracy. In a field where improvements usually come fractions of a percent at a time, that 5 percent jump is a big deal. It\u2019s also a big deal to businesses, which are trying harder than ever to automate the task of figuring out what people are saying about them online . Almost every tweet, review, blog post or other piece of content expresses an opinion, but employing a human being to scan every one and instigate some sort of response or enter them into a database isn\u2019t exactly efficient. Early approaches to sentiment analysis or social media monitoring have been kind of crude, often focusing on individual words that don\u2019t account for context at all. @derrickharris Thanks for being a Quiznos fan, Derrick! Here\u2019s a coupon to use on your next visit: http://t.co/yWS2wDlhi6 \u2014 Quiznos (@Quiznos) February 27, 2013 Socher\u2019s team pulled off its accomplishment by focusing not just on single words, but on entire sentences. It took nearly 11,000 sentences from online movie reviews (from research database culled from Rotten Tomatoes, specifically) and created what the team has dubbed the Sentiment Treebank. What makes the Sentiment Treebank so novel is that the team split those nearly 11,000 sentences into more than 215,000 individual phrases and then used human workers \u2014 via Amazon Mechanical Turk \u2014 to classify each phrase on a scale from \u201cvery negative\u201d to \u201cvery positive.\u201d The team then built a new model it calls a Recursive Neural Tensor Network (it\u2019s an evolution of existing models called Recursive Neural Networks ), which is what actually processes all the words and phrases to create numeric representations for them and calculate how they interact with one another. When you\u2019re dealing with text like movie reviews that contain linguistic intricacies, Socher explained, you need a model that can really understand how words play off each other to alter the meaning of sentences. The order in which they come, and what connects them, matters a lot. A simple example of what Socher means would be a sentence like \u201cThere are slow and repetitive parts, but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting.\u201d \u201cUsually,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat comes after the \u2018but\u2019 dominates what comes before the \u2018but,\u2019\u201d and that\u2019s something a model focusing on single words or even single phrases might not be able to pick up. A visual representation of how Socher\u2019s model breaks down sentences. That sample sentence and the visual representation actually come from a website Socher\u2019s team built to show off and help train its model. The site includes a link to the research paper, as as well a live demonstration of the model on whatever sentences people enter, and a tool for exploring the Sentiment Treebank to see how it has classified sentences containing specific words. The code for the model will be available for download on the site in late October. Over time and with more sample sentences, Socher thinks his model could reach upward of 95 percent accuracy, but it will never be completely perfect. This is because there are always certain word combinations, sentence structures and jargon that don\u2019t appear enough to let the model effectively determine patterns in how they\u2019re used. The movie review training set, for example, didn\u2019t include many emoticons, so Socher\u2019s team is working on adding them to its system. It also had to develop algorithms to analyze the morphology of words. For example, Socher noted, the word \u201cabsurdly\u201d is used infrequently, but an algorithm is able to figure out that adding \u201cly\u201d to a word doesn\u2019t create a wholly new word with different sentiment. The new model and Sentiment Treebank by Socher and his team come as deep learning is catching on more broadly, thanks in part to research that companies such as Google , Facebook and Microsoft (Socher is actually a Microsoft Research Ph.D. fellow) have been publicizing in fields such as image recognition (or\u00a0computer vision), speech recognition and even language understanding. Earlier this week, IBM announced a research partnership with four high-profile universities that focuses in part on deep learning. Socher acknowledged the impressive work done elsewhere, but he\u2019s not convinced there\u2019s much commercial utility in focusing too much on image recognition (at least right now) or on single words. (Google and others would probably disagree, maybe quite strongly, and probably could probably raise some very good points.) So he and\u00a0his Stanford colleagues have been focusing on phrases and sentences, and aside from sentiment analysis, he says their models are pushing the state of the art in areas such as machine translation , grammatical analysis and logical reasoning. \u201cYou\u2019ll never care about translating a single word to another single word,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201dWe\u2019re actually able to put whole sentences and longer phrases into vector spaces without ignoring the order of the words.\u201d", "lede": "Stanford Ph.D. student Richard Socher appreciates the work Google...", "link": "http://gigaom.com/2013/10/03/stanford-researchers-to-open-source-model-they-say-has-nailed-sentiment-analysis/"}, {"author": "Kevin Fitchard", "title": "TextNow brings its all-IP mobile service to the Galaxy SIII and LTE", "feed_title": "GigaOM", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:38:56", "content": "TextNow became the first all-IP mobile operator in the country in August when it started selling a $19 plan and two Android phones that relied solely on Sprint\u2019s data networks to deliver voice and messaging services.

In the three years that Dhir has joined Apple, he spearheaded efforts to push Apple products in the Indian market by boosting the network of Apple-exclusive stores, shortening the time span between the launch of new models overseas and in India, and expanded the Indian team threefold to more than 150 executives. Last year,\u00a0 Apple\u00a0turned to independent distributors \u00a0to sell its iPhone throughout the country, as the lack of\u00a0carrier subsidies limited adoption in India.\u00a0Apple has also reportedly been keen to\u00a0 push its iPhone in India \u00a0with more advertising as well as numerous discount schemes and monthly installment options. The company quietly launched the iPhone 5 in India in\u00a0 November last year . Next up for Apple in India: it wants to blaze its way into smaller cities and towns through its iPhones, iPads and iPods, as the population in these smaller markets is becoming richer and youths are aspiring toward Apple products. Apple is targeting 100 exclusive standalone stores under the franchisee model in these smaller Indian markets, and is seeking to roll them out this fiscal year, executives at a closed-door meeting hosting by Apple India told the Economic Times. India is a market with lots of potential According to figures from research firm Canalys in August, India managed to snag third place in worldwide smartphone shipments in Q2 2013, thanks to rapid growth of 129 percent to hit 9.0 million. It is little wonder that besides increasing its efforts to appeal to Chinese consumers, Apple also wants a slice of the pie in India.

However, the increasing threat from low-cost manufacturers in these countries is a problem for Apple.\u00a0Canalys noted back in August that the only international vendor to really succeed in India was Samsung.

Ars Technica made the discovery , and has a comprehensive account of the difference it made. In basic terms, this means Samsung has adjusted\u00a0the phone so that it recognizes benchmarking software and knows to run flat-out when it is being put through its paces. Benchmarking is commonly used by many tech media and analysts as a way to compare devices, showing which phones or tablets perform fastest across various categories and settings. Many critics are calling Samsung\u2019s actions cheating because the Note 3 does not run this fast in \u2018real world\u2019 conditions \u2014 it has battery-saving software and over-heating safeguards that kick in and prevent it from over-performing with any single app or activity. Their argument is that Samsung and others \u2014 for the company is not alone in benchmark optimizing \u2013\u00a0do this so that their devices score better in the tests, garners more impressive media coverage and are thus more attractive to those who are looking to buy a smartphone. But here\u2019s the thing, the storm being whipped up about this issue is totally overblown. User experience comes first Yes, Samsung is being deceitful to a point, but it\u2019s not like the scores are artificial or entirely fake, as they come from the device itself.\u00a0A more pertinent issue here is really how much emphasis is placed upon data, as people elevate the importance of benchmarking in particular I\u2019m not saying that benchmarking isn\u2019t a worthy pursuit, but its significance is too often overemphasized \u2014 perhaps by us technology geeks in the media, or those who like charts and statistical comparisons. The fact remains that a phone is about the user experience, and switching a few settings to generate \u201csmall gains in performance\u201d \u2014 to quote Anandtech \u2014 is really besides the issue. Support for apps, a fluid user experience, the potential to upgrade, price and plenty of other user-focused metrics are far more important and worthy of consideration when deciding on the quality of a phone \u2014 as TNW\u2019s own Nick Summers pointed out last week . To put it another way. Most people don\u2019t shop for a car based on its top speed, we look for things that will impact (or help) our daily lives. Yet you wouldn\u2019t criticize Toyota, Nissan, BMW and others for listing a car\u2019s top speed despite the fact that 99 percent of customers will never get to drive it that fast. The speed is pretty much irrelevant to the purchasing decision or any media review. The same logic should be applied to benchmarking. This is the domain of enthusiasts and statisticians, not everyday consumers. Everyone is \u2018cheating\u2019 Finally, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Samsung \u2014 which was found to have optimized the Galaxy S4 for benchmarking this summer \u2014 isn\u2019t alone in doing what it does. Anandtech notes that\u00a0\u2019cheating\u2019 is pretty much rife within the industry: With the exception of Apple and Motorola, literally every single OEM we\u2019ve worked with ships (or has shipped) at least one device that runs this silly CPU optimization. It\u2019s possible that older Motorola devices might\u2019ve done the same thing, but none of the newer devices we have on hand exhibited the behavior. It\u2019s a systemic problem that seems to have surfaced over the last two years, and one that extends far beyond Samsung. Were the issue to affect real-world testing, then it would be more serious. However, it\u2019s not clear how that would work,\u00a0and, in my opinion, that is a very different reality to wanting to showcase a device\u2019s optimal performance in benchmark testing, which is purely performance-oriented. For what it\u2019s worth, Samsung has denied \u00a0the accusations, claiming that \u201cthe\u00a0Galaxy Note 3 maximizes its CPU/GPU frequencies when running features that demand substantial performance.\u201d Images via\u00a0 vesna cvorovic \u00a0/ Shutterstock, Thinkstock", "lede": "Samsung is currently under fire for optimizing its newest devices...", "link": "http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2013/10/04/samsungs-benchmark-rigging-proves-we-need-a-better-way-to-judge-smartphone-performance/"}, {"author": "Jon Russell", "title": "Zynga founder Pincus says he was misquoted and is only bored of the \u2018current crop\u2019 of games", "feed_title": "The Next Web", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 06:19:30", "content": "Zynga founder Mark Pincus has responded to suggestions that he is fed up \u00a0with the gaming industry by claiming he has been misquoted and taken out of context.

Talks are said to be \u201cpreliminary,\u201d with operating systems head\u00a0Terry Myerson planning a visit to Taiwan to discuss the proposal in more detail. In addition, outgoing Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer visited China last week in a bid to secure licensing deals with new partners, as the company looks to avoid a situation in which Nokia \u2014 which Microsoft is in the process of acquiring \u2014 is the sole Windows Phone partner. As a company that has produced both Windows Phone and Android devices, it seems logical that HTC would be a target that Microsoft is aggressively pursuing \u2014 particularly in light of HTC recording its first-ever quarterly loss . Struggling to win market share, a Windows Phone-Android device could provide some differentiation on the competition \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear if it would appeal to consumers. Windows Phone\u2019s share of the smartphone market is said to be close to 10 percent in a number of European markets , but that figure is as low as 3 percent in the US .

(The company has since appealed the ruling.) Kaleidescape makes home theater machines\u2014devices that can keep all of your DVD and Blu-ray\u00a0movies in a single location and play them without the hassle of digging through DVD cases to find the right disc. The thing that sticks out about Kaleidescape is that its home theater boxes aren't small. These are typically enormous devices that cost many thousands of dollars, and the boxes are more likely to be installed by a home theater contractor than by a normal consumer. Any self-respecting home theater geek these days likely already has a setup designed to do something similar. This usually takes the form of a home theater PC running XBMC or one of its variants , with video and music stored either on internal storage or connected to a NAS over Ethernet. Doing this will get you a system that does most of the things Kaleidescape's boxes do, but the DIY route comes with the added hassle of installing and maintaining your own software. You also need to acquire a working knowledge of disc ripping and encoding, a task that isn't terribly difficult \u00a0but isn't terribly easy\u00a0 either. Kaleidescape's systems automate a significant chunk of the HTPC experience, wrapping the movie ripping and storage aspect in a single attractive package that looks and functions more like an appliance than an HTPC. The company's traditional products, as mentioned, are expensive \u2014like, $10,000-type expensive. They're great for an upmarket customer who wants to wire every room in his or her vacation home up for movie watching, but it's not a great option for the more middle-class among us. The Cinema One is Kaleidescape's attempt at moving a bit down the market. The system still isn't anywhere near approaching \"cheap,\" but it is significantly less expensive than previous Kaleidescape offerings. A Cinema One will set you back about $3,000. Expense is relative, but that's still a heart-stopping chunk of change. For that amount of money, though, you get an awesome home theater system that stores hundreds of movies and can access hundreds more online. It's a great little box, but is it worth it? That depends. Let's dive in. Unboxing and physicality The Cinema One arrived tucked away neatly inside its box, along with an accessory kit containing a very normal-looking infrared remote control with batteries, a power brick and cord, an Ethernet cable, an HDMI cable, and a tiny USB 802.11n Wi-Fi adapter. It's gratifying to see the cables and the Wi-Fi adapter already included. Considering the device's price, their absence would be inexcusable. Lee Hutchinson The Kaleidescape Cinema One's box, unopened. Lee Hutchinson The Kaleidescape Cinema One's box, unopened. Lee Hutchinson The box includes a big quick-start guide with lots of movies on it. Lee Hutchinson The Quick Start guide is quite helpful and includes info on setting up the Cinema One's remote to control your TV and other AV gear. Lee Hutchinson The accessory box contains a remote control with batteries; cables for power, Ethernet, and HDMI; and an 802.11n Wi-Fi USB dongle. There's a large fold-out poster stuck atop the accessory kit showing how to get the system up and running quickly. This includes details on how to program the remote to control your television, receiver, and other things in your A/V stack. The system is designed to look exactly like a DVD or Blu-ray\u00a0player. Its dimensions mirror those of a typical player, and it has a pleasant clutter-free white plastic bezel with a disc slot, a light-up logo (which dims during movie playback), and a trio of buttons. Those buttons allow you to eject a disc, rip the disc's contents to your library, and power the system on and off. The system's casing is metal and quite sturdy; the entire thing weighs about 10 lbs (4.6 kg). The port layout on the back of the unit is as pleasingly sparse as its front bezel\u2014from left to right, there's a power plug, an HDMI port, analog audio output ports, a digital audio coax output port, a USB port (for the Wi-Fi dongle), a gigabit Ethernet port, and a small plug for connecting an additional infrared receiver.

The nation's leading Internet and telecommunications companies have said they are committed to the sanctity of their customers' privacy. I have some very personal reasons to doubt those assurances. In 2004, my telephone records, as well as those of another New York Times reporter and two reporters from the Washington Post , were obtained by federal agents assigned to investigate a leak of classified information. What happened next says a lot about what happens when the government's privacy protections collide with the day-to-day realities of global surveillance. The story begins in 2003 when I wrote an article about the killing of two American teachers in West Papua, a remote region of Indonesia where Freeport-McMoRan operates one of the world's largest copper and gold mines. The Indonesian government and Freeport blamed the killings on a separatist group, the Free Papua Movement, which had been fighting a low-level guerrilla war for several decades. I opened my article with this sentence: \"Bush Administration officials have determined that Indonesian soldiers carried out a deadly ambush that killed two American teachers.\" I also reported that two FBI agents had travelled to Indonesia to assist in the inquiry and quoted a \"senior administration official\" as saying there \"was no question there was a military involvement.'' The story prompted a leak investigation. The FBI sought to obtain my phone records and those of Jane Perlez, the Times bureau chief in Indonesia and my wife. They also went after the records of the Washington Post reporters in Indonesia who had published the first reports about the Indonesian government's involvement in the killings. As part of its investigation, the FBI asked for help from what is described in a subsequent government report as an \"on-site communications service\" provider. The report, by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, offers only the vaguest description of this key player, calling it \"Company A.'' \"We do not identify the specific companies because the identities of the specific providers who were under contract with the FBI for specific services are classified,'' the report explained. Whoever they were, Company A had some impressive powers. Through some means\u2014the report is silent on how\u2014Company A obtained records of calls made on Indonesian cell phones and landlines by the Times and Post reporters. The records showed whom we called, when, and for how long\u2014what has now become famous as \" metadata .\" Under DOJ rules, the FBI investigators were required to ask the attorney general to approve a grand jury subpoena before requesting records of reporters' calls. But that's not what happened. Instead, the bureau sent Company A what is known as an \" exigent letter '' asking for the metadata. A heavily redacted version of the DOJ report , released in 2010, noted that exigent letters are supposed to be used in extreme circumstances where there is no time to ask a judge to issue a subpoena. The report found nothing \"exigent'' in an investigation of several three-year-old newspaper stories. The need for an exigent letter suggests two things about Company A. First, that it was an American firm subject to American laws. Second, that it had come to possess my records through lawful means and needed legal justification to turn them over to the government. The report disclosed that the agents' use of the exigent letter was choreographed by the company and the bureau. It said the FBI agent drafting the letter received \"guidance\" from \"a Company A analyst.'' According to the report, lawyers for Company A and the bureau worked together to develop the approach. Not surprisingly, \"Company A\" quickly responded to the letter it helped write. In fact, it was particularly generous, supplying the FBI with records covering a 22-month period, even though the bureau's investigation was limited to a seven-month period. Altogether, \"Company A\" gave the FBI metadata on 1,627 calls by me and the other reporters. Only three calls were within the seven-month window of phone conversations investigators had decided to review. It doesn't end there. The DOJ\u00a0report asserts that \"the FBI made no investigative use of the reporters' telephone records.\" But I don't believe that is accurate. In 2007, I heard rumblings that the leak investigation was focusing on a diplomat named Steve Mull, who was the deputy chief of mission in Indonesia at the time of the killings. I had known Mull when he was a political officer in Poland and I was posted there in the early 1990s. He is a person of great integrity and a dedicated public servant. The DOJ\u00a0asked to interview me. Of course, I would not agree to help law enforcement officials identify my anonymous sources. But I was troubled because I felt an honorable public servant had been forced to spend money on lawyers to fend off a charge that was untrue. After considerable internal debate, I decided to talk to the DOJ\u00a0for the limited purpose of clearing Mull. It was not a decision I could make unilaterally. The Times also had a stake in this. If I allowed myself to be interviewed, how could the Times say no the next time the government wanted to question a Times reporter about a leak? The Times lawyer handling this was George Freeman, a journalist's lawyer, a man Times reporters liked having in their corner. George and the DOJ\u00a0lawyers began to negotiate over my interview. Eventually, we agreed that I would speak on two conditions: one, that they could not ask me for the name of my source; and two, if they asked me if it was \u2018X,' and I said no, they could not then start going through other names. Freeman and I sat across a table from two DOJ\u00a0lawyers. I'm a lawyer, and I prided myself on being able to answer their questions with ease, never having to turn to Freeman for advice. Until that is, one of the lawyers took a sheaf of papers that was just off to his right and began asking me about phone calls I made to Mull. One call was for 19 minutes, the DOJ\u00a0lawyer said, giving me the date and time. I asked for a break to consult with Freeman. We came back and answered questions about the phone calls. I said that I couldn't remember what these calls were about\u2014it had been more than four years earlier\u2014but that Mull had not given me any information about the killings. Per our agreement, the DOJ\u00a0lawyers did not ask further questions about my sources, and the interview ended. I didn't know how the DOJ\u00a0had gotten my phone records, but I assumed the Indonesian government had provided them. Then, about a year later, I received a letter from the FBI's general counsel, Valerie Caproni who wrote that my phone records had been taken from \"certain databases\" under the authority of an \"exigent letter,'' (a term I had never heard). Caproni sent similar letters to Perlez, to the Washington Post reporters, and to the executive editors of the Post and the Times, Leonard Downie and Bill Keller, respectively. In addition, FBI Director Robert Mueller called Downie and Keller, according to the report. Caproni wrote that the records had not been seen by anyone other than the agent requesting them and that they had been expunged from all databases. I'm uneasy because the DOJ\u00a0report makes clear that the FBI is still concealing some aspect of this incident. After describing Caproni's letters, the report says, \"However, the FBI did not disclose to the reporters or their editors that [BLACKED OUT].\" The thick black lines obliterate what appear to be several sentences. If you were to ask senior intelligence officials whether I should wonder about those deletions, they'd probably say no. I'm not so sure. The government learned extensive details about my personal and professional life. Most of those calls were about other stories I was writing. Some were undoubtedly to arrange my golf game with the Australian ambassador. Is he now under suspicion? The report says the data has been destroyed and that only two analysts ever looked at it. But who is this 'Company A\" that willingly cooperated with the government? Why was it working hand in glove with the FBI? And what did the FBI director not tell the editors of the Times and the Washington Post when he called them acknowledging that the government had improperly obtained reporter's records?

Still, it seems much more realistic when you see the fully navigable, 3D virtual reality version of Mars that Norris and other JPL researchers have already created using funding from NASA's Game Changing Development program and some technology originally designed for more realistic gaming. While it's pretty awe-inspiring to be able to look at the surface of another world through panoramic photos or IMAX movies , a flat image is not exactly the best way to study the surface of another planet. \"If you're looking at a panoramic image on a flat monitor... you might think that something's to your right that's actually behind you, because you're looking at a rolled out picture,\" Norris pointed out. \"Or you might zoom in on something and think 'Oh, that's significantly to the right of me.' But because you're zoomed in so far, it might just be a couple of degrees to your right, because you don't have the reference points on Mars.\" That's part of why JPL has been looking into ways to let researchers and members of the public experience the data it's getting from Mars more naturally. In the past, the team has looked into room-sized \"surround theaters\" that project images from the Martian surface on the floors, walls, and ceilings, ensconcing users in a Martian environment. These installations are comfortable, but also quite expensive. They also require users to make a special trip to use them. For a more portable home or office-based simulation, the team turned to gaming technologies to make navigating more intuitive and effective. \"We're always watching the market for new devices that are potentially useful for work,\" Norris said. \"We like working with video game technologies because they're designed to be very accessible for people. They also tend to be very low cost.\" Norris seems particularly excited about the team's current research, which combines an HD prototype of the Oculus Rift head-mounted display with Vicon's Bonita position tracking system . Users can actually walk and look around a simulation of the Martian surface, as shown in a video the team released today. The people behind the Oculus are excited as well. \u201cVirtual reality is immediately useful as a way to get people excited about space again, and as the hardware advances, it will become a powerful tool for real research and exploration,\" Oculus CEO Palmer Luckey told Ars. \"In particular, virtual reality based telepresence\u00a0could allow human operators to perform tasks in hostile environments without actually going there themselves. For many use scenarios, the dexterity and locomotion capabilities of a human piloted robot will surpass what a real person in a spacesuit can do. JPL has some amazing stuff in the pipeline that is going to have a big impact on mankind. It makes me very happy to see people using virtual reality and the Rift for the greater good.\" Virtual Mars JPL's simulation of the Martian surface is put together by taking a panoramic parallax image sent by a Martian rover and stitching it together onto the surface of a virtual cylinder about 50 square meters (164 square feet) in base area. Researchers then superimpose 3D point cloud data gathered by the rover on top of the scene, creating a series of meshes called \"surflets\" that give the impression of depth. The result, as you see in the video, is a fully explorable, accurate 3D slice of the Martian surface sent to Earth from hundreds of thousands of miles away. \"When you consider all of the data that Curiosity has acquired, plus Opportunity and Spirit, we have hundreds of these sites,\" JPL Human Interfaces Software Engineer Victor Luo told Ars. Being inside a 3D virtual Mars is undoubtedly cool, but it also has important applications as a research tool, Norris said. Using the Oculus Rift, researchers can study the data sent by Curiosity just as they would view the world around them\u2014by moving their heads and walking around. Norris said that using these natural human abilities to engage with different environments is key to making them more effective explorers in a strange world. \"Think about how amazing of an ability every human has to extract vast amount of information from the environment just by being present in it,\" Norris said. \"Then you consider that geologists and other scientists build on those abilities with specialized training and field work and things like that. But then we ask them to go and explore the planet by peering at flat images on ordinary computer monitors and so on. We have some evidence that this makes our natural abilities work against us rather than for us. This project is about correcting that.\" Adding the Vicon motion tracker to the setup gives researchers another ability they don't easily have with flat pictures of the Martian surface: the ability to walk around and examine bits that interest them up close. \"If you're looking at pictures taken by the robot, you're kind of frozen where the robot is,\" Norris said. \"We want people to be able to get up and move around in that space.\" More than just locomotion, though, Norris said the motion tracker adds verisimilitude via the \"little motions\" humans make when looking around, such as shifting a shoulder or leaning the neck to one side. This kind of parallax motion is a key way that humans and other animals assess depth and distance in their environment, and it allows for a much more accurate impression of the user's virtual Martian surroundings. Enlarge / This might not look that impressive on your flat computer screen, but just wait until you can experience it on an HD head-mounted display. This is all useful for researchers on the ground trying to form scientific hypotheses about the Martian landscape, of course. But Norris sees this kind of technology being used by the operators navigating Martian rovers, letting them \"be more informed and better aware of the environment of the robot, what we call the morphology of the environment\u2014what's it shaped like, where are the rocks, what orientation are they, how are they arranged. When you're driving a robot around on another planet, it's important to know what the environment right around it is...\" he said. The future As impressive as the working prototype JPL has up and running is, it's very much a first draft of the kind of virtual reality environments the lab hopes to create. In the future, JPL researchers are looking to integrate other data to make the virtual Martian environment more detailed, including data from lower-resolution orbital photos and true-color rover \"Mastcams\" that generate much higher spatial resolution when zoomed in. The model may even eventually integrate data from wide-field, close-mounted \"hazard cameras\" that were designed to monitor the area immediately surrounding the rovers' treads and robotic arm for safety. Researchers are also looking to increase immersion by adding Martian audio to the simulation, despite a lack of direct sound measurement on the planet itself. \"We don't have a microphone on Mars, so we don't know exactly what it sounds like, but we can model it,\" Norris said. \"Curiosity has a weather station. We know how hard the wind is blowing, we know the atmospheric pressure, we could render the audio in a very convincing way... It should sound like a high whistling.\" As for the user interface, the researchers are looking into adding some kind of accurate hand-tracking to let users reach out and interact with the virtual Martian soil. \"The interaction language inside of a virtual reality environment is kind of non-defined,\" Luo said. \"Using a joystick really doesn't make that much sense when you're on Mars. How would you navigate in that environment? ... Is there some other kind of hardware that could be attached or installed to help with that?\" Norris said the JPL team has experimented with hand-tracking solutions ranging from the LeapMotion and Kinect to the Razer Hydra and accelerometer-based gloves, but no option has really provided the perfect combination of accurate tracking, mobility, and light encumbrance on the hands. Still, he's hopeful that the game industry might help him out on this score in the near future. \"One of the things we love about working in this area is that there are a lot of companies that are attacking these problems for a lot of reasons\u2014video games, entertainment\u2014but we'll benefit as well,\" he said. While JPL is still long way off from releasing its virtual Mars in a way that the public can enjoy, Norris said that \"making it possible for the public to join us on the surface of these distant worlds in a way that feels much more real than looking at a picture on a screen we think is of great importance and really exciting.\" And there's always that eventual goal of letting the world experience the first steps on Martian soil in a holodeck-like environment, of course. \"I think those kinds of events, those kinds of explorations in the future, need to be experienced by our whole civilization, and these technologies are how we can make that happen,\" Norris said. \"It's how we can be a part of that in a way that's so much more real than anything that's ever been available to us before.\"", "lede": "He's not really on Mars... but in a way, he kind of is. \"My dream...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/10/how-gaming-tech-is-making-for-better-interplanetary-exploration/"}, {"author": "Joe Mullin", "title": "Key Senator wants to ban bulk surveillance, leading to Democratic showdown", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:45:10", "content": "NSA leaks View all\u2026 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) expressed support yesterday for serious surveillance reform, saying he will introduce legislation that calls for an end to the National Security Agency's (NSA) mass dragnet of phone data.

However, Leahy\u2014the chairman of the judiciary committee\u2014is clearly in a powerful position from which to move such a bill forward. In the Senate, it's going to be a serious Democrat-on-Democrat battle, since the chairman of the Senate's top intelligence committee, Diane Feinstein (D-CA), has made it clear she will fight such a bill. At a hearing yesterday, Feinstein said the bulk data collection could prevent another event like the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \u201cI will do everything I can to prevent this program from being canceled out\u2026to destroy it is to make this nation more vulnerable,\" said Feinstein,\u00a0according to a Politico\u00a0 report \u00a0on the hearing. The justification for bulk data collection was \"strained at best,\" said Leahy. He doesn't believe the position of the intelligence community that the bulk data program stopped 54 terrorist plots, citing \"inaccurate\" reports from the Obama Administration. \"That\u2019s plainly wrong. These weren\u2019t all plots, and they weren\u2019t all thwarted,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because something is technologically possible, and just because something may be deemed technically legal, does not mean that it is the right thing to do,\" Leahy added.

Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), but neither voiced their positions yesterday, according to Politico. Democrats called for reform but were more focused on smaller measures, like adding an advocate to the FISC. Leahy is working together with politicians pushing an identical bill in the House, where the idea of banning bulk data collection is drawing important supporters like the Republican head of House Judiciary oversight, Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). (Sensenbrenner co-authored the PATRIOT Act). According to Politico, the ranking Democratic member of House Judiciary John Conyers (D-MI) is also a supporter.

AgileBits described security improvements \u00a0including a new keychain design with 256-bit AES encryption keys and data integrity checks that increase resistance to tampering. The design \"forestalls many attacks that\u00a0haven\u2019t even been dreamt of yet,\" AgileBits said. 1Password 4 development was helped along by 20,000 beta testers. 1Password 4's launch price is $39.99 on the Mac App Store, a price that will rise to $49.99. However, anyone who ever purchased 1Password 3 on the Mac App Store can upgrade for free. 1Password 4 will also be available on the AgileBits website in a day or two. Anyone who bought 1Password 3 directly from AgileBits in 2013 will get version 4 for free. Anyone who bought before 2013 can upgrade for $24.99 at launch. That will be increased to 1Password's regular upgrade pricing of $34.99 later on. 1Password has a Windows application too, but that hasn't been upgraded. In general terms, password managers like 1Password automatically fill in your usernames and passwords across any website, automatically generating passwords that are far more secure than most people can remember. Your keychain is protected by a single master password, the only one you have to remember. We described the importance of applications like 1Password in our feature \" The secret to online safety: Lies, random characters, and a password manager .\" There are additional options, such as LastPass , Dashlane , KeePass , Password Safe ,\u00a0 Kaspersky Password Manager , and Roboform . Apple is also planning to release a password manager called iCloud Keychain with OS X 10.9 . Password managers are popular tools among security experts , but they should be considered by anyone who uses the Internet. As noted, there are numerous options beyond 1Password.

NSA leaks View all\u2026 Three United Kingdom-based nonprofit organizations and a German Internet activist have filed a lawsuit against the British government at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), arguing that the UK's electronic spying network is illegal. Documents provided by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden have shown that the UK\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the sister organization to the NSA, has been one of the most prominent players in digital surveillance, particularly of European traffic. The lawsuit was filed Thursday at the ECHR in Strasbourg, France by Big Brother Watch, Open Rights Group, English PEN, and Constanze Kurz , who has been a longtime spokesperson for the Chaos Computer Club, a well-known German hacker group. \u201cBeyond effective legal scrutiny\u201d In the 67-page filing, the appellants argue that the communications interception is in direct violation of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights , Europe\u2019s rough analog to the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Unlike the Fourth Amendment, however,\u00a0 Article 8 specifically carves out a national security exception. It states: Article 8 \u2013 Right to respect for private and family life 1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. In their filing , the appellants argue that because the newly revealed data collection is \u201cindiscriminate,\u201d it cannot possibly be \u201csubject to any sufficiently precise or ascertainable legal framework and is beyond effective legal scrutiny.\u201d More precisely: In effect, the power to obtain and use external communications data by means of intercept is unfettered in published law, as long as it is thought broadly to be in the interests of [national] security or other of the specified generic purpose. There are no adequate criteria by which a court of tribunal could assess the legality of use of any particular intercept material even if the courts had jurisdiction to do so, which they do not. Holding the powerful accountable Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said in a statement that British laws have been interpreted far more broadly than how they originally were intended. \u201cThe laws governing how Internet data is accessed were written when barely anyone had broadband access and were intended to cover old-fashioned copper telephone lines,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament did not envisage or intend those laws to permit scooping up details of every communication we send, including content, so it\u2019s absolutely right that GCHQ is held accountable in the courts for its actions.\u201d The court, which is composed of 47 judges from each of the member states of the Council of Europe, may take months (or years) to render a decision. However, this case likely will be heard by a smaller committee composed of three or seven judges. The ECHR\u2019s own flow chart shows a long process (PDF) that likely awaits this application, along with the 50,000 other new applications that it receives each year. \u201cThe timetable is for the court, but I would hope for the case to be formally communicated to the UK within a couple of months,\u201d Daniel Carey, the chief solicitor in the case, told Ars. \u201cThereafter, they are likely to have two to three months for their response before the court considers next steps.

Earlier today, the first Intel-powered Arduino was announced, and it will be available by the end of November. Arduino has also announced the Arduino TRE, based on the Texas Instruments Sitara AM335x ARM Cortex-A8 processor. Texas Instruments said that with the TRE's 1GHz processor, it is the \"most powerful Arduino to date\" and the first that will be able to run \"full Linux.\" It will be available in spring 2014 from arduino.cc and other distributors, with pricing not yet announced. \"For the first time ever, Arduino users can use the full capabilities of Linux and gain access to a variety of new on-board connectivity options to develop a range of powerful, advanced applications while leveraging the simplicity of the Arduino software experience,\" the Texas Instruments announcement said. \"The Sitara-processor-powered Arduino TRE serves as a network hub that can connect to millions of classic Arduino nodes, enabling customers to be at the forefront of the Internet-of-Things era.\" This also removes the requirement for Arduino to be programmed with a separate PC. \"Arduino users no longer need a PC, but can access the full capabilities of Linux as well as a variety of connectivity options, including Ethernet, XBee wireless radios, USB and CAN,\" Texas Instruments said. \"As a result, users can implement more advanced applications with high-resolution LCD displays, hardware-accelerated 3D graphics and increased connectivity. The AM335x processor also includes two on-chip 200 MHz 32-bit Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) microcontrollers, which can be used for innumerable real-time applications including motor control and pulse width modulation.\" Arduino released its own announcement, saying the TRE will provide \"up to 100 times more performance\" than the Arduino Leonardo or Uno . \"This performance opens the doors to more advanced Linux-powered applications. The Sitara-processor-based Linux Arduino can run high-performance desktop applications, processing-intensive algorithms, or high-speed communications,\" Arduino said. The announcement did not provide a direct comparison to the Arduino Due , which is a year old and was the first ARM-based Arduino with an ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. Arduino also did not compare the TRE's performance to the new Arduino Galileo, which has a 400MHz Intel Quark processor, or say whether Galileo will be able to run Linux as well. We've asked Arduino for further details. ( UPDATE : Intel has answered this question, saying in an FAQ , \"Intel Galileo runs Linux out of the box. It comes in two flavors; the default is a small Linux. If you add an SD card to your kit, you can add a more fully-featured Linux.\" Thanks to commenter MrPippy for pointing this out. ) The TRE is actually \"two Arduinos in one,\" the \"Sitara-processor-based Linux Arduino, plus a full AVR-based (Atmel microcontroller) Arduino, while leveraging the simplicity of the Arduino software experience,\" Arduino's announcement said. \"The integration of the AVR Arduino enables the Arduino TRE to use the existing shield ecosystem so that innovators can expand the Arduino TRE to develop a wide range of high-performance applications such as 3D printers, gateways for building automation and lighting automation, telemetry hubs that collect data from nearby sensors wirelessly, and other connected applications that require host control plus real-time operations.\" Arduino designed the TRE in partnership with one of its ostensible rivals, the BeagleBoard.org foundation . The TRE is also the first Arduino board manufactured in the US. Previous Arduinos were made in Italy.

Photograph by Kyle Orland Today's high-definition game consoles can be big power drainers, drawing around 70 to 100 Watts when in active use (depending on the model). That's down from over 170W of energy draw when the systems were first launched, thanks to firmware updates and hardware redesigns. Still, it can be quite a lot of energy, especially when the systems are being used for relatively simple things like Netflix streaming (an Apple TV, for comparison, only uses about 6W of power, and a Super Nintendo uses only 10W). The energy situation seems poised to improve with the next generation of consoles, though, according to a Polygon report . Systems like the Xbox One were \"designed from the ground up to maximize computational power per watt,\" according to Microsoft Senior Compliance Manager Tim Calland. The Xbox One's scalable multicore design is key to that efficiency, he said. \"One major difference we have now versus the Xbox 360 is scalable architecture, which means that it deals with tasks by just using the amount of computing capacity needed for the work to be done. Gaming is the big high-power experience, but when we are doing lesser functionality like streaming media, we're using much less energy than the Xbox 360 did when we launched... We have eight cores now and we only use the amount that we need. That wasn't an option in the last generation.\" Even when running at full capacity, Calland said that the Xbox One generates \"eight times the computational power for the same amount of energy as Xbox 360 at launch.\" Of course, the Xbox One has a much higher ceiling for computational power than the Xbox 360 did, so the overall energy consumption for players upgrading is still likely to see a bump. Still, there's room for that efficiency to improve over the console's lifetime, just as it did with the current generation of consoles. Calland also confirmed that the Xbox One will be set to shut down after 60 minutes of idle time by default, just like the Wii U. Even though that setting can be overridden by users, turning it on by default can have a surprisingly large effect on a console's aggregate lifetime power consumption.", "lede": "The mess of cables and power bricks required to power my home ent...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/multicore-design-makes-next-generation-consoles-more-energy-efficient/"}, {"author": "Ars Staff", "title": "How the feds took down the Dread Pirate Roberts", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 05:00:25", "content": "If you've been living under a cultural rock the Dread Pirate Roberts was a character from the cult film The Princess Bride (based upon the book of the same name). Aurich Lawson / ACT III Communications The Silk Road bust View all\u2026 The Dread Pirate Roberts, head of the most brazen drug trafficking site in the world, was a walking contradiction. Though the government says he raked in $80 million in commissions from running Silk Road, he allegedly lived under a false name in one bedroom of a San Francisco home that he shared with two other guys and for which he paid $1,000 a month in cash. Though his alleged alter ego penned manifestos about ending \"violence, coercion, and all forms of force,\" the FBI claims that he tried to arrange a hit on someone who had blackmailed him. And though he ran a site widely assumed to be under investigation by some of the most powerful agencies in the US government, the Dread Pirate Robert appears to have been remarkably sloppy \u2014so sloppy that the government finally put a name to the peg leg: Ross William Ulbricht. Yesterday, Ulbricht left his apartment to visit the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco Public Library in the southern part of the city. Library staff did not recognize him as a regular library patron, but they thought nothing of his visit as he set up his laptop in the science fiction section of the stacks. Then, at 3:15pm, staffers heard a \"crashing sound\" from the sci-fi collection and went to investigate, worried that a patron had fallen. Instead, library Communications Director Michelle Jeffers tells us that the staff came upon \"six to eight\" FBI agents arresting Ulbricht and seizing his laptop. The agents had tailed him, waiting for the 29-year-old to open his computer and enter his passwords before swooping in. They marched him out of the library without incident. For a promising young physics student from Austin, Texas, this wasn't how things were supposed to turn out. Ulbricht, in happier times. \u201cChoose freedom over tyranny\u201d Sure, you could buy meth, LSD, cannabis, heroin, and MDMA on the Silk Road, but the hidden website wasn't (just) about drugs. Silk Road was, said its owner, about freedom. In January 2012, as part of a \"State of the Road Address\" posted in the site's discussion forum, the Dread Pirate Roberts explained the site's goal: \"To grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.\" To that end, the Dread Pirate Roberts built the Silk Road marketplace in 2011 as a \"hidden\" service accessible only over the encrypted Tor network. To connect, users first had to install a Tor client and then visit a series of arcane site names (the most recent was silkroadfb5piz3r.onion), but the reward was a simple, effective marketplace to buy drugs from sellers all over the world using such Internet commerce staples as escrow accounts and buyer feedback. The product was shipped through the mail, direct from seller to buyer, keeping the Dread Pirate Roberts clean. The only link between him and the drugs was the money, and Roberts eventually took only the electronic currency called Bitcoin to make this hard to trace. He even ran a program called a \"tumbler\" to route incoming Bitcoin payments through a complicated series of dummy transactions, so as to make them infeasible to trace through the public Bitcoin blockchain. Out of each transaction, Roberts took a cut\u20148 to 15 percent, depending on the size of the sale. This eventually earned Roberts a pirate's treasure. By 2013, Silk Road had nearly one million user accounts. In the 2.5 years the site operated, it facilitated 1.2 million transactions worth 9.5 million Bitcoins\u2014or about $1.2 billion in total money exchanged. (Bitcoin values varied widely over this period.) Roberts picked up a cool $80 million in commissions. No surprise, then, that the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and the FBI all joined forces to track down Roberts and the largest sellers on his marketplace. In November 2011, after coming under pressure from Congress, the agencies began the hunt and quickly found that Roberts had been right\u2014encryption, Tor, and \"tumbled\" Bitcoins were a potent combination to crack. Ulbricht at his 21st birthday party. But investigations always have many threads to pull. The feds couldn't initially follow the money to Roberts, nor could they find the physical location of his cloaked servers. In the absence of usual digital clues, the feds fell back on a low-tech approach: keep going back in time until you find the first guy to ever talk about the Silk Road. Find that guy and you probably have a person of interest, if not Roberts himself. So they looked, assigning one agent to conduct \"an extensive search of the Internet,\" in the FBI's words, looking for early Silk Road publicity. The earliest post ever to mention the site appeared on a drug-oriented forum called shroomery.org, where a user named \"altoid\" had made a single post . It read: I came across this website called Silk Road. It's a Tor hidden service that claims to allow you to buy and sell anything online anonymously. I'm thinking of buying off it, but wanted to see if anyone here had heard of it and could recommend it. The post directed readers to visit silkroad420.wordpress.com, belonging to the blogging operator WordPress, where further instructions would be found for accessing the real Silk Road site. A subpoena to WordPress Revealed that the blog had been set up on January 23, only four days before the Altoid post. If this wasn't the first mention of Silk Road, it was certainly one of them. Altoid became a person of interest, but who was he? Further research revealed that Altoid had been posting on a board called Bitcoin Talk\u2014further suggesting a possible link to the Silk Road, which operated on Bitcoin. A key break came when the agent found an October 11, 2011 post by Altoid, looking for an \"IT pro in the Bitcoin community\" and directing all inquiries to \"rossulbricht at gmail dot com.\" A subpoena to Google revealed that this account was in fact registered to one \"Ross Ulbricht.\" The account was also linked to a Google+ profile, which had a picture of Ulbricht and a link to his favorite videos on YouTube . The videos provided a key clue; several of them were from the libertarian Mises Institute, whose views jibed with the leanings of the Dread Pirate Roberts. In addition, Roberts had repeatedly linked up Mises videos when posting in the Silk Road forum and had referenced \"Austrian school\" economists like Ludwig von Mises, for whom the Institute was named. The clue was suggestive but not conclusive. Still, the pieces were coming together. The economic simulator Enlarge / Ulbricht and his horseshoe mustache. With the name Ross Ulbricht, the feds went to other social networks. They found Ulbricht on LinkedIn, where he talked about his dissatisfaction with the physics work he had been doing as a graduate student at Penn State. \"Now, my goals have shifted,\" Ulbricht wrote. \"I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind... The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.\" Could the \"economic simulation\" be, in fact, Silk Road? One tantalizing hint comes from an anonymous article published in alternative newspaper The Austin Cut , located in Austin, Texas where Ulbricht grew up. The story was, in essence, a primer on how to build Silk Road and an explanation of what made the site so amazing\u2014and the answers were \"freedom\" and \"lack of force.\" \"Hackers, anarchists, and criminals have been dreaming about these days since forever,\" wrote the author. \"Where you can turn on your computer, browse the web anonymously, make an untraceable cash-like transaction, and have a product in your hands, regardless of what any government or authority decides... This is about real freedom. Freedom from violence, from arbitrary morals and law, from corrupt centralized authorities, and from centralization altogether. While Silk Road and Bitcoin may fade or be crushed by their enemies, we've seen what free, leaderless systems can do. You can only chop off so many heads.\" The article's author then relayed a telling anecdote from Silk Road, one in which people began arguing over a botched deal. They got angry; one threatened violence, but he was simply mocked by other users because he had no way to find his target. \"It showed how successful Silk Road really is,\" wrote the author. \"It makes drug buying and selling so smooth that it's easy to forget what kinds of violent fuckers drug dealers can be. That's the whole point of Silk Road. It totally takes evil pieces of shit out of the drug equation. Whether they're vicious drug dealers or bloodthirsty narcotics cops, both sides of that coin suck and end pretty much the same way. Death, despair, madness, prison, etc. Thanks to decentralization and powerful encryption, we're able to operate in a digital world that is almost free from prohibition and the violence it causes.\" This fits with Ulbricht's arguments, and the piece might well be by him, providing a better sense of why he saw the experiment as such an important one. We asked the editor of the Cut what he thought. \"I wondered the same thing,\" he said, but he added that he didn't know who wrote the piece. In any event, the feds had a name but no hard evidence linking Ulbricht to the site management. They knew that Ulbricht had moved to San Francisco and was staying for some time with a friend, and they knew that whoever was logging into the \"rossulbricht\" Gmail account was doing it on occasion from the friend's house. But the next link in the chain only came when the feds uncovered a post on the popular coding advice site StackOverflow. In early 2012, Ulbricht registered a StackOverflow account using his Gmail address; the username was \"Ross Ulbricht.\" On March 16, Ulbricht asked for help with connecting \"to a Tor hidden server using curl in php.\" He included several lines of code that weren't working quite right. Perhaps realizing that this was a bad idea, one minute later Ulbricht changed his username to \"frosty\" (he changed his e-mail address a bit later), but he had already revealed his interest in running Tor sites. At this point, the government gets cryptic. On July 10, 2013, Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package coming from Canada into the US as part of a \"routine border search.\" This package contained nine counterfeit IDs, each of them in a different name, but each of them showing a picture of Ulbricht. They were addressed to his San Francisco address. Two weeks later, the government found the Silk Road servers in various foreign countries, though it won't say how. (The FBI gives no indication that Tor was compromised in this case, though given that the agency has recently found ways to spy on Tor users, it's hard to absolutely rule out the possibility.)\u00a0It's possible that finding various aliases for Ulbricht enabled agents to track the money used to pay for the servers, but the events may have been unrelated. The main Silk Road Web server was found in \"a certain foreign country\" that has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US. Under the terms of that treaty, the government asked for an image of the server's hard drives, which was made on July 23 and then turned over to the FBI. ( Update : Computer security research Nicholas Weaver speculates that \"the FBI (with a warrant) hacked the site sufficient to discover the site's IP by generating a non-Tor phone-home and then contacted the country of the hosting provider which then got the server imaged. Yet since the server imaging didn't involve taking the server down or disrupting service sufficient to spook Mr DPR into taking his bitcoins and running, I suspect that this was some virtual-machine hosting provider.\" But at this point, no one knows.) Three days later, agents from Homeland Security Investigations visited Ulbricht's 15th Street home in San Francisco. They found him at home, where his two housemates knew him as \"Josh.\" One of them told the agents that \"Josh\" was \"always home in his room on the computer.\" As for Ulbricht himself, he refused to answer most questions, though he did volunteer one curious bit of information, apparently as a way of indicating that such documents could be obtained so easily that anyone might have ordered them, or that he had been framed. \"Hypothetically,\" he told the agents, anyone could visit a site named \"Silk Road\" on \"Tor\" and order any drugs or fake IDs they wanted.", "lede": "If you've been living under a cultural rock the Dread Pirate Robe...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Twitter Reveals $1 Billion IPO Plan", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 09:31:46", "content": "Twitter Inc. on Thursday revealed plans to raise up to $1 billion in a public offering, looking to cash in on a messaging service that has transformed public conversation but is still losing money and facing challenges attracting new users and advertisers.

Twitter had previously shielded the figures by filing its initial IPO documents confidentially in July, under a new federal law. The amount raised in the filing is an estimate that could change when Twitter launches its investor \"roadshow,\" where it will formally pitch its stock to investors. The document suggests Twitter recently valued itself at about $9.7 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding, or at about $13 billion when including equity awards. Twitter chose TWTR as its ticker symbol but hasn't specified whether it will trade on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market .

Bios: Who's Who at Twitter Read about the leaders and founders of Twitter. In seven years, Twitter has grown from a wobbly startup to a social phenomenon where in just 140 characters its 215 million monthly active users tap out more than 500 million messages each day. The short-message service serves as a global forum in which users break news, organize protests and gripe about what they ate for lunch. As early as 2008, Twitter turned eyewitnesses into \"citizen journalists\" who reported on a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Now, once-elusive public figures including the pope, Warren Buffett and Kanye West \"tweet\" their thoughts and interact with other users. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo uses the service to answer users' troubleshooting queries. Businesses, stock pickers and politicians alike analyze the sentiments expressed on Twitter as important indicators. Despite its ubiquity, Twitter remains an immature business. The filing showed Twitter has far fewer users and generates less revenue per user than Facebook . When Facebook filed for a public offering, the company revealed sales of $3.7 billion and a profit of $1 billion for 2011. It also had 845 million monthly active users, a huge bragging point as it pitched itself to investors. Twitter's growth is also a question. The majority of Twitter's revenue, about 75%, is from the U.S., even though three-quarters of monthly users are outside the U.S. Facebook also has a wide gap between its usage and its ad revenue outside the U.S., where advertising businesses typically are less mature. In the second quarter, Twitter's growth in monthly active users slowed to 7% from three months earlier, compared with 10% to 11% growth in the prior three quarters. Like Facebook, Twitter makes money mostly by selling advertising based on users' posts. As they compete for advertisers, both companies position themselves as the world's online town square. Twitter also has as a second business licensing its data companies that analyze user tweets for insights on news events and social trends. That business generated $47.5 million in revenue last year, roughly 15% of the total. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is spearheading Twitter's IPO, but its rival Morgan Stanley won a measure of vindication by landing the second-biggest role in the deal. Morgan Stanley had led Facebook's IPO, and was criticized after Facebook shares fell as much as 50% in their first three months of trading, though the stock has since recovered and is well above its initial price. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. also is in the lead group of banks, meaning that the same three banks that led Facebook's IPO will lead Twitter's. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank AG are also serving as underwriters. The largest Twitter shareholder specified in the filing is co-founder Evan Williams , who owns 12% before the offering. He became Twitter's CEO in 2008 before being replaced by Mr. Costolo in 2010. At Twitter's most-recent internal valuation, Mr. Williams' stake would be valued at nearly $1.2 billion. Other major shareholders listed in the filing include venture-capital firm Benchmark Capital, which owns 6.7% and invested in Twitter early on; co-founder Jack Dorsey, with 4.9%; and Mr. Costolo, who holds 1.6%. Based on the internal valuation, Benchmark's stake would be valued at about $651 million; Mr. Dorsey's stake would be worth roughly $483 million; and Mr. Costolo's shares would be valued at about $155 million. Four other venture-capital firms, Rizvi Traverse, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and DST Global, are listed as owning at least 5% of the shares, but specific share counts aren't listed. The clock is now ticking on when Twitter can begin its roadshow. The IPO filing must be public for at least 21 days before the company can set a price range and say how many shares it is selling. Companies typically take at least a week to travel to different cities and meet investors on the roadshow. That means if the process moves at full speed, Twitter could begin trading around the end of the month or the first week of November. As for the federal government shutdown, a person familiar with the deal said there isn't a big worry right now. But a shutdown extending three weeks or longer could possibly slow the offering if the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't operating at all when Twitter begins the roadshow, this person said. The deal will be watched by other technology companies looking to go public, such as Box Inc., an online storage company, and Square Inc., the mobile-payments company created by Mr. Dorsey. Several of those companies delayed potential public offerings after shares of Internet companies such as Facebook, Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. sagged after their debuts. But shares in Internet companies have surged this year, amid a broader rally in the U.S. stock market. \u2014Rolfe Winkler and Elizabeth Dwoskin contributed to this article.

A partnership including Jared Kushner , a 32-year-old real estate developer and technology investor, closed on Wednesday on five of six properties in a $375 million deal and he said they plan to convert them into a hub for technology companies. The Watchtower properties are being sold by the Jehovah's Witnesses, one of the largest properties the church has sold as it relocates its headquarters upstate. An agreement to sell the sixth building would close in 2017. The 1.2 million-square-foot complex will be at least 50% offices, said a person familiar with the matter, with bigger and pricier spaces aimed at more mature companies than most in the neighborhood. The partners would undertake a roughly $100 million renovation of the buildings, accommodating up to 5,000 bikes, creating outdoor roof space, allowing for 150,000 square feet of retail space occupied almost entirely by Brooklyn companies and installing state-of-the-art Internet connectivity. Mr. Kushner, chief executive of Kushner Companies, said the developers would work with the city to try to convert some area streets into pedestrian plazas. \"We saw these buildings as an opportunity to really create a great campuslike environment,\" Mr. Kushner said. To many neighborhood observers, the plans for the complex would solidify the transformation of Dumbo\u2014one of Brooklyn's main office districts\u2014from its status in the early 2000s as an offbeat neighborhood for startups into a high-profile office destination that competes with neighborhoods like Flatiron and Chelsea. \"Dumbo will become more official, more formal and more professionalized by these tenants,\" said Chris Havens, a commercial broker who worked for five years at Two Trees Management Co., the largest property owner in the area. \"It's turned from a village into a town.\" Rents at the tech campus would be in the mid-$50s per square foot, according to people familiar with the matter. That would make them about double the rents in the rest of Dumbo, and about $10 below rents for hip Manhattan spaces. Bloomberg News Jared Kushner, above in February, sees 'an opportunity to really create a great campus-like environment' in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood. Mr. Kushner said he and his partners, RFR Realty and LIVWRK Holdings, a real-estate startup by Asher Abehsera, a former Two Trees' executive, weighed whether the complex should include more housing or office space. \"We would make more money if we did the whole thing as residential, but we would have less fun,\" Mr. Kushner said. The decision to focus more on office space is likely an easier sell to the community. Mr. Kushner and his partners would need to rezone parts of the property they would convert to residential use, which requires approval from the local City Council member, Stephen Levin. Mr. Levin said he hasn't been briefed on the details of the plans but said Mr. Kushner seemed savvy about the need for more office space in the area. The area under the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge overpasses was once one of Brooklyn's main manufacturing hubs, home to firms like Arbuckle Brothers and makers of the Brillo pad. The cobble-stoned neighborhood went into steep decline in the late 20th Century as companies moved their operations out of the city, but it began experiencing a residential revival in the 1970s when artists started moving in. By the 1980s, a few companies began moving in, and today the area has some 1.8 million square feet of office space. \"Dumbo has not been this tight since 1945, since World War II,\" Mr. Havens said. The history of the Jehovah's Witnesses site mirrors Brooklyn's industrial decline. The printing facility, operated through much of the 20th century, was once the largest in the city, producing hundreds of millions of Bibles, books, magazines and pamphlets, according to Richard Devine, a church spokesman. The organization closed its printing operations in the city in 2004 as large-scale modern equipment demanded more sprawling facilities. The organization's plans for a new campus upstate became known in 2009. Since then developers and community leaders have speculated about the future of the printing site, the most prominent development opportunity in an area dominated by landmarked funky warehouse buildings. The city also recently announced a deal with a developer to convert the Empire Stores, vacant warehouse buildings in Dumbo, to retail and about 300,000 square feet of office space. Two Trees executives said they aren't concerned about competition with a huge block of new office space because rents for newer spaces are significantly higher and their buildings tend to appeal to smaller companies. \"We're at zero vacancy. If Dumbo continues to become a home for these types of company, I think supply contributes to that perception,\" said David Lombino, director of special projects at Two Trees. \"A rising tide lifts all boats.\" Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com A version of this article appeared October 4, 2013, on page A25 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Deal Will Transform Dumbo.", "lede": "For four years, a cluster of properties near the foot of the Manh...", "link": "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304906704579113823704492920.html"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Samsung Predicts Record Profit", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:05:44", "content": "Article Excerpt BY MIN-JEONG LEE AND JONATHAN CHENG SEOUL\u2014Samsung Electronics Co. issued guidance for record operating profit in the third quarter, but the company could face pressure from shareholders to unleash its cash pile as saturation in the smartphone market threatens a slowdown in earnings growth for the South Korean company.

(After all, consumers don't camp out for days to buy new cars or clothes.) So it isn't surprising that one fan set out to erect a photographic shrine to every single Apple product ever created, from the Apple I computer in 1976 to the iPad mini. Apple Products Through the Years Jonathan Zufi See a selection of photos from a new coffee-table book about Apple products. Photos and captions by Jonathan Zufi. Four years ago, Jonathan Zufi, a 42-year-old Australian native, began buying up more than 500 products: desktops, Apple's first commercial printer and iPods\u2014some in vintage packaging. He rented a storage unit to hold all the goods. He built a studio in the basement of his Atlanta home to photograph them, placing each item carefully against the same type of futuristic white backdrop used on apple.com and in Apple stores. He got a photography professor to help him learn to take professional shots. \"I wanted to create a repository where people who also love the company and its products could go and reminisce,\" says Mr. Zufi, a mobility expert at SAP America Inc. who says he has never worked for Apple Inc. The idea, he says, was to trace the company's evolution both in electronics and design from a user's point of view. \"I want people who are a bit younger who think Apple just makes things that start with \"i\" to know this company used to make clunky printers.\" The result is a collection of more than 150,000 photos, some 3,500 of which Mr. Zufi displays on a website (www.shrineofapple.com) and more than 650 of which he has curated into a new 326-page coffee-table-sized book. \"Iconic: A Photographic Tribute to Apple Innovation,\" is self-published and available at www.iconicbook.com. A new self-published book, \"Iconic,\" offers catnip to Apple zealots. Photographer and Apple enthusiast Jonathan Zufi assembled a photographic tribute to every product Apple ever made. Photo: Jonathan Zufi A paean to the evolution of the personal computer and a company that changed consumer behavior, it looks like the kind of book Apple itself might market\u2014except that the company has long been adamant about focusing on the future rather than celebrating its past. Apple even donated its old hardware, papers, and other historical materials to Stanford University in 1997. Representatives from Apple didn't respond to requests for comment about the project. Unlike many other books about Apple, Mr. Zufi's consists of photos and little text. There is a circuit board from the original Apple computer, the Apple I, which \"now seems as primitive as the Model T,\" writes Daniel Kottke, one of the company's original employees, in an introduction to a chapter on desktops. There's the Apple II, circa 1977, one of the first successful home computers, and a Macintosh prototype in a transparent case\u2014which Mr. Zufi says illustrates co-founder Steve Jobs ' obsession with making computer electronics fit a particular design. There's a \"Flower Power\" iMac G3, known for its brightly-colored plastic bubble-shaped design, and an Apple Lisa 2, which was a commercial failure. There are digital cameras and joysticks. There's also an entire chapter on packaging\u2014another Apple design obsession. Along the way, Mr. Zufi met with collectors around the country, loading dusty collections of valuable prototypes into rental cars and photographing them, sometimes in makeshift studios in hotel rooms. He convinced Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak to contribute a foreword to the book. In an email, Mr. Wozniak said Mr. Zufi included equipment that few would even know about, including Mr. Wozniak himself. The work \"blows me away,\" he said. Mr. Zufi says his original goal of shooting every Apple product will be impossible to meet. \"I am still finding out about products they dabbled with, released in limited numbers in specific markets, and so on,\" he says. While he has emptied the storage unit and sold most of the items he bought, about 15 remain, including an enormous monitor in his garage, he says.

The move increases the number of titles available on Scribd's subscription service to more than 50,000 available from traditional publishers, Scribd said. But HarperCollins isn't making its new titles available, which could limit the service's appeal. Neither side would disclose the precise number of older books coming from HarperCollins. Scribd is one of a number of online book-subscription programs emerging, as technology executives explore whether the success of subscription offerings in music and television can be emulated with books. \"We want to be the Netflix of books,\" said Trip Adler, chief executive of Scribd, a San Francisco-based company that is closely held by its founders and a small group of equity investors. Scribd offers unlimited access to its titles for $8.99 a month. The company, whose online platform hosts e-books and documents from numerous sources, also will sell new and backlist titles from all HarperCollins's U.S. imprints. Other publishers providing books to the Scribd subscription service include Kensington Publishing Corp., which is providing new and old titles. \"We're interested in exploring the subscription model and seeing how it performs,\" said Steve Zacharius, Kensington's chief executive. Among other new subscription services is a company called Oyster, which launched in September. Oyster subscribers paying $9.95 a month have unlimited access to more than 100,000 titles. North Carolina-based eReatah Inc. is expected to launch later this month with 90,000 new and old titles from traditional publishers. Unlike Scribd and Oyster, eReatah will offer a tiered pricing approach. HarperCollins has struck deals to supply a limited number of titles to both eReatah and Oyster. CBS Corp.'s Simon &amp; Schuster has also struck a deal to supply books to eReatah. But most other major publishers have been wary about striking deals with subscription services, worried about cannibalizing book sales. Book executives also question whether consumers will embrace such subscription services, particularly as the new services have limited books available, particularly among new releases. \"If somebody wants the new Stephen King or John Grisham, and they can't get it, they'll go somewhere else,\" said Carol Fitzgerald, president of the Book Report Inc., a closely held company that operates a network of websites connecting books and readers. \"Also, can't people do this through their local library and get whatever they want?\" HarperCollins isn't providing new titles to Scribd subscription users. \"I don't know if it makes sense strategically to include new books,\" said Brian Murray, chief executive of HarperCollins, noting the potential for conflict with book retailers. HarperCollins is a unit of News Corp, which also owns The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Murray added that he considered the agreement with Scribd to be significant because of its \"huge installed base of active users and its global reach.\" Scribd claims 80 million active users and is available in 100 countries.

STEWART and SUZANNE VRANICA The website Songsrpeople.com looks a lot like other amateur-video sites. It is wallpapered with clips featuring \"the most insane amusement park ever\" and \"your girlfriend's six friends.\" The site draws tens of thousands of visitors a month, according to audience measurement firms. It also has ads for national brands, including Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and State Farm. But Web-security investigators at a firm called White Ops contend that most of the site's visitors aren't people. Rather, they are computer-generated visitors, or \"bots,\" designed to fool advertisers into paying for the traffic, says White Ops, which has blacklisted the site\u2014and thousands more like it\u2014so that ads from clients such as Zipcar don't land there. An anonymous representative for Songsrpeople declined to discuss the site's traffic but in an email called the White Ops methodology into question. State Farm said it was looking into the matter while Target declined to comment and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Authorities and Internet-security experts say tens of thousands of dubious websites are popping up across the Internet. Their phony Web traffic is often fueled by \"botnets,\" zombie armies of hijacked PCs that are controlled from unknown locations around the world, according to Internet security experts. The sites take advantage of the simple truth that advertisers pay to be seen. This creates an incentive for fraudsters to erect sites with phony traffic, collecting payments\u2014often through middlemen and sometimes directly from advertisers. \"When you walk into this world, you walk with eyes wide open,\" said Brian Harrington, chief marketing officer at Zipcar, which ran a recent ad campaign, assisted by White Ops to filter out bogus traffic. \"You know stuff is not real.\" At their most sophisticated, botnets can mimic the behavior of online consumers, clicking from one site to the next, pausing at ads, watching videos, and even putting items in shopping carts. Earlier in the year, an FBI operation, \"Ghost Click,\" resulted in two men from Estonia pleading guilty in U.S. federal court in New York for their roles in a botnet ad-fraud scheme. The fraud involved four million hijacked computers in 100 different countries and yielded at least $14 million for a group of seven, federal prosecutors said. \"It's drug-level money, but you don't have to kill anyone,\" says Tamer Hassan, a co-founder and chief technology officer of White Ops, a year-old startup in New York that has developed technology that it says can spot robotic traffic and uncover digital ad fraud. Security experts say that botnets can be rented or purchased on private forums and message boards around the world. In a translation of one proposal written in Russian, a member called \"Shantaram\" offers to drive 1,000 visitors to any website for $1, noting that it can source the traffic to any country \"desired.\" Hackers build botnets by infecting computers with malware, which are regularly buried in email attachments or disguised as legitimate website downloads. Those infected computers are then connected by a command machine, which stealthily directs the network of zombies to do its work, whatever it may be. A computer user may not be aware of it. Ad industry executives blame the murky and complicated online ad ecosystem for creating an environment for the fraud. Most publishers, big and small, sell inventory through multiple channels, using middlemen who aggregate space across a host of sites and resell it to brands. The middlemen include ad networks, which often have sales teams, as well as ad exchanges, which employ automated systems that allow advertisers to bid on publishers' inventory. That inventory can be supplied either directly by the publisher, by ad networks, or through other companies that help websites sell their ad space. It isn't unusual for marketers to now have ads running across hundreds of different websites, elevating the chances that ads could land on questionable sites, unbeknownst to the advertiser. Even when advertisers find out their ads ran on a botnet-fueled site, there's no formal process for them to get their money back, ad buyers say. Automated systems have \"enabled greater buying efficiencies and controls, but also made it easier for the bad guys,\" said Arthur Muldoon, co-founder and chief executive of the media buying firm Accordant Media, whose clients include Starwood Hotels, Seamless and Zipcar. To sift out bad traffic, Accordant uses a growing cast of security and verification companies, including comScore Inc., DoubleVerify and White Ops. Last year it doubled the money it spent on their services. Accordant also has a swelling blacklist of sites where it won't buy ads. That list has tripled from last year and now includes hundreds of thousands of sites. White Ops was founded by Mr. Hassan, Michael J.J. Tiffany, Ash Kalb and well-known Internet security researcher Dan Kaminsky about a year ago and operates out of a science-fiction bookstore in Brooklyn. Early on, the company chased bank fraud schemes. But that changed when someone at a party showed Mr. Tiffany a snapshot on his iPhone: a $900,000 check from an ad network. The acquaintance said he had gamed the ad network into thinking he hosted sites with big traffic. \"It got me thinking, 'We should take a look at this,'\" said Mr. Tiffany, the chief executive of the company. White Ops has cataloged tens of thousands of suspect websites. Its technology identifies bots in real time and then prevents ads from going to the bad sites. The aim is to strike at the cash flow of the scam sites instead of trying to put \"guys in handcuffs,\" Mr. Tiffany says. Digital ad spending in the U.S. is expected to jump 14.9% this year to $42.3 billion, according to eMarketer. Most websites make money from advertisers based on how many people visit the sites. While low traffic sites can earn 25 cents per thousand views, more well-known sites can make as much as $20 for every thousands views. Video ads tend to fetch higher ad rates. Some experts say ad networks and exchanges aren't screening the publishers they work with well enough, and therefore are partly responsible for botnet-related fraud. Critics say the middlemen have a conflict of interest, since they get a cut of fees advertisers pay. \"If they reduce the fraud, they reduce their revenue,\" said Jeremiah Grossman, founder and chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security, a Web-application security firm in Santa Clara, Calif. \"Follow the money\u2014the blame [for the fraud] lies with the entity that gains the most,\" said Susan Bidel, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \"That would be the publishers and every middleman that gets a fee to process [the ad buy]. They are all complicit in some way, whether they are actively complicit or passively.\" The middlemen say they are doing their best to stamp out fraud using their own filter techniques and policing teams to weed out fraudulent publishers. They reject the notion that they are turning a blind eye to botnets. \"Everybody recognizes that this is a problem,\" said Steve Sullivan, vice president of advertising technology at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a digital ad industry trade group. \"The reality is some of those companies are in fact doing the best they can.\" While some scammers create stand-alone operations, others devise sprawling empires. In one case, the White Ops technology uncovered a zombie-populated lifestyle network, with hundreds of connected sites, including bodybuildingfaq.com, financestalk.com, and abctraveling.com. No one at the sites could be reached for comment. In some scenarios, legitimate websites inadvertently set themselves up for botnet invasions when they hire companies to help boost their traffic. That can involve building audiences through methods such as paid keyword-search advertising with search engines. White Ops discovered that more than 30% of the visitors to the education portal Education.com were robots. In the past month the site received about four million unique views, according to Quantcast. A spokesman for Education.com said it was aware of the bot-traffic and that it had likely come from an initiative in the summer to boost its audience numbers. Education.com had bought traffic from a variety of legitimate sources, including search engines, to lure in new subscribers, as well as users \"who would perform well for advertisers.\" \"We shut down the program,\" the spokesman said. Online measurement company comScore said well-known websites with heavy traffic can have single digit percentages of bad traffic while lesser-known sites might get 25% of their traffic from bots. The losses to ad fraud are hard to nail down. Security company Solve Media Inc., for instance, estimates that up to 29% of display advertising traffic world-wide is driven by bot armies, and could cost advertisers roughly $10 billion dollars this year, the company said. Microsoft Corp. and security-software maker Symantec Corp. recently went after a network called Bamital, which the companies estimated had been taking in more than $1 million a year from ad fraud. A federal court order shut down Bamital and U.S. Marshals confiscated the servers behind the cyber operation. The companies are now doing forensics on the equipment, hoping to uncover in part the workings of a botnet business, as well as the location of the people behind it. One botnet called ZeroAccess is thought to have hijacked 685,000 computers in the U.S., according to Alcatel-Lucent Kindsight Security Labs, a unit of Alcatel-Lucent. Every day, it generates about 140 million ad views on sites with fake traffic whose \"sole purpose appears to be to host ads,\" costing advertisers some $900,000. Write to Christopher S.

This dramatic principle is called Chekhov\u2019s gun, and it actually applies quite well to the natural world: Animals don\u2019t waste energy developing worthless characteristics. Traits that help a species survive get passed along through generations, while those that are no longer useful fade away (or in the stubbornly contrary case of the human appendix, abruptly explode). If Chekhov had time-traveled back between 8 million and 20 million years and met Platybelodon \u2014 an ancestor of the modern elephant that looked like it got hit in the face with a shovel, then absorbed that shovel into its mouth \u2014 he would have demanded the creature explain itself. What possible purpose could such a ridiculous trait serve? \u201cA good one, thank you very much,\u201d Platybelodon would reply, probably in a really funny voice. The spork-faced Platybelodon\u2019 s strange jutting jaw actually consists of a second pair of flattened, widened tusks (tusks themselves being modified incisors). When the genus Platybelodon , which means \u201cflat tooth,\u201d and its species were first described in the 1920s, \u201ctheir lower incisors were thought to function to shovel, scoop, dig and dredge soft vegetation in aquatic or swampy environments,\u201d vertebrate paleontologist William Sanders of the University of Michigan wrote in an email to WIRED. \u201cBut recent analysis of tusk wear surfaces show that they were used more as scythes to cut tough vegetation.\u201d The paleontologist who proposed this slicing behavior in 1992, David Lambert, theorized that instead of roaming shorelines, Platybelodon fed on terrestrial plants, grasping branches with its trunk and cutting them away with its built-in scythe. Indeed, cross-sections of the tusks reveal a structure that provides extra strength and resistance to abrasion for such foraging, said Sanders. So it could well be that Platybelodon wandered around Miocene Asia, Africa, and North America, scything vegetation like some sort of peasant, only without all the pesky class struggles. And it was just one of a horde of similar animals in the family Gomphotheriidae , all with modified lower tusks of varying styles. The Platybelodon genus alone had more than 15 species, reaching \u201cthe apex of development of these lower tusks,\u201d according to Sanders. Their radically flattened teeth suggest \u201cstrong selection for specialized feeding on a particular range of plants,\u201d which was crucial given that \u201cfor much of the Miocene there were often three to five or more genera of proboscideans occurring in the same landscape, competing for forage.\u201d Pegging the various appearances of such proboscideans, though, is difficult, because flesh-like schnozes don\u2019t fossilize as easily as bone. We\u2019re actually quite lucky to have Platybelodon preserved at all, considering that fossilization is a really hard thing to pull off . Even if you can avoid getting carted off in a dozen different directions by scavengers, you need to settle in the right spot. And Platybelodon just so happened to do us a solid by dying \u2014 sometimes en masse \u2014 next to or in rivers, the prime locales for fossilization. Henry Fairfield Osborn, a paleontologist who described Platybelodon in a 1932 paper and quite extensively four years later in his book Proboscidea , accordingly assumed the creature to be a water-dredger (thanks to the work of Lambert and others we now believe that Platybelodon , like a lot of animals, was probably just partial to water and happened to sometimes die in it). In his book, Osborn quoted another paleontologist, Alexei Borissiak, who in 1929 wrote that Platybelodon was \u201cdeprived of a trunk\u201d but would scoop through the water and \u201cseize its food with its muscular upper lip, covering the mandible.\u201d In fact, Borissiak reckoned Platybelodon\u2019 s snout looked a bit like that of the hippopotamus, \u201calthough much more lengthened out.\u201d Osborn\u2019s illustrations of Platybelodon certainly reflect this. But \u201cthink about what an elephant looks like,\u201d Sanders asks us. \u201cThe trunk is a very separate entity from the mouth. You have to be able to get food into your mouth, and if your front limbs are occupied in posture, and you have upper and lower tusks that would make it difficult to have a long projecting tongue or mobile lips, then you need a proboscis.\u201d \u201c[Osborn's] ego preceded his expertise,\u201d he added, \u201cand we are still digging out from the weight of his \u2018authority\u2019 on proboscideans.\u201d Yet Osborn\u2019s flat trunk/lip persists in most modern reconstructions \u2014 including an oh-so-close-to-actually-being-cute one in the Ice Age movies \u2014 conflicting with Lambert\u2019s more widely accepted grab-and-scythe theory. Trunks aside, could the bizarre mug of Platybelodon , so wonderfully adapted for feeding, have proved cumbersome when, say, fleeing from predators? Sanders doesn\u2019t think so. And even if Platybelodon did face-plant here and there, its size would have proved quite the advantage as far as not getting eaten goes. It was somewhat smaller than the modern African elephant, which only rarely falls prey to that continent\u2019s apex predator, the lion.

It was also popularized by photographer Vincent Laforet, who used a tilt-shift lens to make the real world look like a miniature model of itself (check the photos here and here ). It was a different way of seeing things that was surprising and fun to look at. The problem is, most of us aren\u2019t as good as Laforet, so we have to proceed with caution if we\u2019re going to make effective selective-focus pictures. Too often we get sidetracked by the technique and forget to make a picture that can stand on its own. Boring food photo? Shoot it with a selective focus lens or apply the feature in Instagram, and voil\u00e0! \u2014 a slightly less boring food photo. This misuse, or overuse, puts Lensbaby and its Pro Effects Kit (made for Canon and Nikon DSLRs) in a tough position. The kit offers two selective-focus optics, two macro converters, and a carrying case. It all costs $730, which is a good chunk of change to spend on something that should probably be used sparingly. Another knock against the kit is that it\u2019s not the easiest thing to use. To attach Lensbaby optics to your DSLR you first have to snap something called the Composer Pro onto your camera\u2019s lens mount. The Composer Pro comes with the kit and is the piece that, using a ball and joint system, lets you swivel the optics around and choose where you want your spot of focus, or \u201csweet spot,\u201d to land. Then you choose which optic \u2014 the \u201cSweet 35\u2033 (35mm focal length) or the \u201cEdge 80\u2033 (80mm focal length) \u2014 to insert into the composer. Being able to choose different optics is a nice feature, but inserting and removing the optics is a total pain. The first time I mounted the Sweet 35 I thought it was secure but it fell out as soon as I picked up the camera. To remove an optic you have to master a push and spin technique that is not easy. I thought I broke the optics several times because I had to push so hard. It takes a minute to figure out how to control the swivel of the composer and place the sharp spot of your focus. But after a while it becomes fairly routine. In terms of ease of use, I prefer the Edge 80. At that focal length your sharp spot of focus is more defined and easier to place where you want it. Once I got the hang of everything, I admit I had fun testing the kit. It was a refreshing challenge to try and find \u201cappropriate\u201d uses for the optics, and I never had any complaints about the quality of the glass and the sharpness of my pictures. Both optics are reasonably fast \u2014 the aperture on the Edge 80 goes to 2.8 and the aperture on the Sweet 35 goes to 2.5 \u2014 so they performed well in low light on my Canon 5D Mark II. Since the test, however, the optics just sit in my bag. That\u2019s partly because I\u2019m in front a computer most of the time. But it\u2019s also because I find myself weary of pulling them out unless I\u2019ve planned a shoot that highlights their strengths. The entire Lensbaby Pro Effects Kit costs considerably less than one Nikon or Canon tilt shift lens ($1,300 \u2013 $2,500), which also creates a selective focus effect. But dollar for dollar I can think of several other $730 purchases I\u2019d rather have in my camera bag quiver. If you\u2019re set on using a selective focus lens on your DSLR, you can buy the Composer Pro with just the Sweet 35 for $380. The Edge 80 by itself sells for $300. If that\u2019s still too much, you might try the Lensbaby Spark. It\u2019s a low-end 50mm selective focus optic with a fixed aperture that you focus with rubberized bellows. It\u2019s not half as sharp as the Sweet 35 or the Edge 80, but at $90 it\u2019s a good way to get your feet wet. The photos you get with the Spark often resemble something you\u2019d get from a toy camera, but if used with a little ingenuity, it can be a lot of fun and you\u2019ll spend a lot less money trying to figure out if selective focus photography is indeed for you.

But Cady Coleman found a way to get Sandra Bullock\u2019s. All she had to do was go into space. Back in 2011 the NASA astronaut was on an expedition on the International Space Station while her brother Chris Coleman was on Earth \u2013 California, specifically \u2013 meeting a man whose sister-in-law happened to be Bullock. The two got to talking about what their family members did and decided they needed to connect Coleman and Bullock, who was about to star in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s lost-in-space flick Gravity . \u201cIt took a week or so to be able to talk [to her] just because we have an internet-protocol phone on the station that we can use to make calls, but I needed her cell phone number \u2013 you can\u2019t call us, we can call you,\u201d Coleman told WIRED, while not on a space station. \u201cShe\u2019s probably not so used to giving out that cell phone number so I had to write and say, \u2018You can give me your number, I won\u2019t give it away.\u2019\u201d Eventually Coleman, who has logged more than 4,330 hours in space for NASA on two space shuttle missions and that stint on the ISS, was able to chat with Bullock \u2014 from space \u2014 and give her advice on everything from how to move in zero gravity to how to deal with the psychological toll of being unable to go home (something Bullock\u2019s Ryan Stone struggles with heavily while trying to get back to Earth in Gravity ). She also began recording voice memos of things she thought might be helpful for the actress and sending her audio clips of helpful pointers. \u201cI\u2019d be going about my work and think, \u2018Oh Sandra would probably want to know about this,\u2019\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIt did kind of make me fly around the space station with new eyes, because I was trying to be Sandra\u2019s eyes.\u201d It worked. Bullock\u2019s performance in Gravity is shattering, and the film \u2014 in Coleman\u2019s eyes \u2014 is the most accurate portrayal of her actual experiences in space ever to make it to the big screen (minus the debris collisions). WIRED asked Coleman about her talks with Bullock, truth in Hollywood movies, and the importance of female astronauts in movies. WIRED: Visually, Gravity feels incredibly life-like. How close is it \u2013 visually \u2013 to what you\u2019ve experienced as an astronaut? Cady Coleman: Something that\u2019s frustrating to me in my job is that I think it\u2019s a very special job. It\u2019s been a great privilege to go to space and to see the things that I see. Really, just to be up there doing work that you just know is really important in such a special place, and yet you don\u2019t really get to bring anybody that you know and love with you. A movie like this is a way for me to bring people to space. I will bring my mother to this. I will make everybody in my family go see this. I don\u2019t know what other people who haven\u2019t seen space think, but I feel like you get to see the view. I met Cuar\u00f3n in the last couple weeks and he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been to space!\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t been to space \u2013 since you made that movie.\u201d WIRED: Was there anything that felt inauthentic? Coleman: I couldn\u2019t help but look at some things and go, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d do that.\u2019 But that\u2019s not the point of the movie. I don\u2019t know if when Apollo 13 came out everyone ran around going \u2018Is that real? Is that real?\u2019 because [it wasn't] quite as sensational \u2026 But people do ask [about how authentic Gravity is], and partly they\u2019re asking because, boy, if it\u2019s that real then why would anybody ever go? It\u2019s sensational. It\u2019s a lot of things that maybe could happen, but for them all to happen on the same day is more than coincidental. But they\u2019re all things that we consider at NASA. WIRED: Yeah, space debris is obviously out there and a concern for space travel. How likely is it that astronauts would get pummeled by it the way they are in this movie? Coleman: In Gravity there\u2019s the debris storm that we see in the trailers, and the astronauts are knocked free and they\u2019re spinning in space. Well, we think about that all the time when we\u2019re doing space walks because it\u2019s really the worst thing in the world that could happen. So, what do we do at NASA? We make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s a really real risk, but we do what we can to mitigate it. I think that\u2019s true of some of the other things you see in Gravity \u2013 what makes it scary in the movie is that it is real, but not real to that extent. WIRED: What was your brother doing when he met Bullock\u2019s brother-in-law? Coleman: My little brother is a wine guy in Sonoma. He\u2019s in the innovative wine-packaging business. Specialty-cask sampling is I think how I\u2019m supposed to say it. As his sister I\u2019m not allowed to say that he does really, really high-end wine in a bag, but that\u2019s what he does. He met Sandra Bullock\u2019s brother-in-law and they got together and figured out what their sisters and sister-in-laws did and got us together. Sandra and I did this interview together recently \u2013 it was specifically for NASA, to air on a NASA channel \u2013 and the interviewer said, \u2018How did you and Cady meet?\u2019 And she looks at me and she says, \u2018Wine.\u2019 I had to look at her and go, \u201cWe have to start again, because if we don\u2019t they can\u2019t use it. We can\u2019t use an interview that starts with \u2018wine.\u2019\u201d WIRED: So what kind of advice did you give Sandra Bullock when you called her from the ISS? Coleman: My recollection is that we mostly talked about two kinds of things. One was physically how do you move up there? What do you hold on to? Are you fluid, are you angular, are you sort of dragging yourself around? The other was what it felt like to live in a place so far away from everybody that you know on the ground. And how do you deal with that separation and the fact that you can\u2019t just go home when you want. WIRED: What is that strain like? Coleman: Even the training is hard on your family \u2013 on your family life. It\u2019s hard to be away from your kid. [Ed. Note: Coleman has a husband and 13-year-old son.] Yet I feel like I was selected for this job and trained and invested a lot, and I believe in what we do and that it\u2019s the right thing for me to be at work when I\u2019m at work and not at home. But I think there\u2019s an emotional price that you pay for that compartmentalization. WIRED: Did you enjoy the fact that that lead in this film was a female astronaut? Coleman: I did. I love it when the hero of a film is a woman. And it\u2019s a woman who uses her head and thinks out what she knows and when that doesn\u2019t work she thinks again and she\u2019s very persistent. These are a lot of qualities that I think are very important that are going to be portrayed to a bunch of 13-year-old girls and they\u2019re going to think they\u2019re normal. They\u2019re going to realize that it\u2019s normal to be the hero. That it could be them \u2013 the hero could be them. The number of people that ask me if I feel bad about leaving my kid at home is too many to count, right? Sometimes I resent that they don\u2019t ask the guys the same question, which is insulting to the guys who also miss their kids. The answer is, \u201cYes, I feel really bad, but it is also the right thing to do.\u201d WIRED: Did any of that thinking inform your conversations with Bullock? Coleman: There has to be a little part of her that is thinking when we first talked, \u201cOk, I\u2019m talking to a woman that\u2019s just like left her kid on the planet and went away and didn\u2019t think anything of it. What kind of woman can do that?\u201d I think we went from that to realizing that I\u2019m the same kind of woman that feels badly about that but it feels like the right thing to do. I think making that human part of living in space \u2026 It\u2019s about the whole person up there. The very humanness of being up there was very clear for me and I believe that\u2019s some of what she got from talking to me.

It\u2019s yet another step in the rocky evolution of the so-called sharing economy, where companies such as Airbnb attempt to facilitate a more fluid exchange of goods and services via the internet. Most of the clashes over what\u2019s also being called \u201ccollaborative consumption\u201d have taken place in the heavily regulated arenas of rooms and rides. Airbnb chalked up a victory in one of the most recent disputes. Instead of gloating, however, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky extended a self-interested olive branch. Following New Yorker Nigel Warren\u2019s successful appeal of his $2,400 fine for renting out a room through Airbnb, Chesky said the company wants to work with New York City to create a clear legal framework for people to rent out their rooms and homes. \u201cOur hosts are not hotels, but we believe that it makes sense for our community to pay occupancy tax, with limited exemptions for those who earn under certain thresholds,\u201d he wrote . \u201cWe would like to assist New York City in streamlining this process so that it is not onerous.\u201d Chesky\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \u201cour hosts are not hotels\u201d \u2014 is interesting because it frames the willingness to collect taxes as a concession. Sharing-economy businesses such as Airbnb tend to portray themselves as platforms for facilitating connections between private individuals. Airbnb isn\u2019t running a hotel chain, the logic goes: it\u2019s helping people extract value from an unused asset \u2014 in this case, an apartment that would otherwise sit empty while the tenant is away for the weekend. As such, Airbnb\u2019s willingness to allow the collection of the city\u2019s hotel occupancy tax is a way of making nice, versus an alternative approach such as, say, battling the city in court over the definition of \u201chotel.\u201d If such a tax plan goes into effect, the money involved would probably be rather large. Airbnb says 15,000 people rent out their spaces through the company \u2014 87 percent of them the homes in which they live, according to Chesky. In New York City, hotel rooms renting for $40 per night or more are taxed at a rate of $2 per day per room plus 5.875 percent of the rate. So, a one-bedroom apartment near Times Square listed for $139 with a minimum three-night stay would involve an occupancy tax of more than $36 total. While that kind of extra charge might seem to cramp the sharing economy\u2019s style, it\u2019s the kind of compromise that seems inevitable. In California last month, the state\u2019s public utilities commission passed the country\u2019s first uniform regulations for ride-sharing , creating a legal framework for companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar. In effect, the rules require ride-sharing companies to follow the same safety and insurance standards as traditional taxi companies \u2014 standards the ride-sharing companies say they already exceed. Without such legal sanctions, however, the only other place sharing-economy disputes are likely to end up is in court. When it comes to who gets to share what with whom and who gets paid, conflict is inevitable. The only question is whether those conflicts get resolved through legislation or litigation.", "lede": "Airbnb \u2014 the company that lets you pay to stay wherever a strange...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/airbnb-taxes/"}]}, {"cluster": 24, "articles": [{"author": "Mary Bates", "title": "Dolphin Hear, Dolphin Do: Imitation by Echolocation", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 15:26:00", "content": "Humans are born imitators. The ability to imitate others comes naturally to us and plays a major role in how we learn about the world. But imitation is not widespread in the animal kingdom. True imitation, which goes beyond merely mimicking another\u2019s behavior to include purposeful intention, is rare. Dolphins are one of the few animals that can truly imitate. In 2010, researchers at the Dolphin Research Center (DRC) in Grassy Key, Florida, showed dolphins can imitate behaviors without using their eyesight . Dolphins were trained on a \u201cdo-as-I-do\u201d game, in which a model (in this case another dolphin) performed a specific behavior and the target dolphin was asked to imitate it. A young male dolphin named Tanner was able to imitate the model dolphin\u2019s behaviors even when he was \u201cblindfolded\u201d \u2014 fitted with soft, latex eyecups that completely blocked his sight. Now, a follow-up study shows not only how Tanner accomplished this task using sound, but also that he used a deliberate, problem-solving approach to imitation. The research was published in the journal Animal Cognition . Kelly Jaakkola, lead author on the two papers and Director of Research at DRC, suspected Tanner was using sound to imitate, but there were two possibilities: \u201cHe could have recognized the characteristic sound the behavior makes, just like you or I might recognize the sound of hands clapping, or he could have used echolocation to \u201csee\u201d the behavior with sound,\u201d she says. In the follow-up study, Jaakkola and her team changed how the behaviors sounded by using a human model instead of a dolphin. Like the dolphin model, the human model performed a variety of motor behaviors including bobbing up and down, spinning in a circle, and swimming like a fish with legs and feet moving side-to-side. A person moving in the water sounds very different from a dolphin moving in the water. With the sound changed, would Tanner still be able to recognize the behavior to copy it? Jaakkola and her colleagues showed Tanner had no problem imitating the human model using sound alone. But even more interesting was how he used sound. Tanner switched strategies when imitating a dolphin and a human. Specifically, when he imitated a human blindfolded, he produced many more echolocation clicks than when he had imitated a dolphin blindfolded. \u201cWhen he had been imitating the familiar-sounding dolphin behavior, he just recognized the characteristic sound of the behavior,\u201d Jaakkola says. \u201cBut when we gave him the less familiar sound of a human doing the behavior, he switched to using echolocation.\u201d This is the first demonstration of flexibility in using a new perceptual route to imitation in any non-human animal. Not only did Tanner use a new perceptual route, he switched strategies depending on the situation. He was flexible enough to seek new information, change strategies, and change his approach to the task. Jaakkola says this shows he wasn\u2019t just copying \u201cmindlessly,\u201d but was instead engaged in imitation as an intentional, problem-solving process. These experiments demonstrate dolphins can recognize and imitate trained behaviors, but Jaakkola is also interested in investigating spontaneous imitation in problem-solving situations. So far, all dolphin imitation studies have used the \u201cdo-as-I-do\u201d procedure where the dolphin is specifically asked to imitate a learned behavior. But in the real world, much of the value of imitation comes from observing how others solve problems and then spontaneously adopting their technique. The DRC team hopes to probe dolphins\u2019 abilities to imitate novel behaviors and look into whether dolphins spontaneously use imitation to learn from each other in more natural situations. Such experiments would not only shed light on the dolphin mind, but the evolution of imitation, as well. Since true imitation is so rare in the animal kingdom, it is likely that the ability evolved separately in humans and dolphins. Learning how dolphins use their imitation skills could provide insight into why they, and humans, became imitating animals at all. \u00a0 References: Jaakkola, K., Guarino, E., and Rodriguez, M.

These latter folks are the same ones who irrationally lust over crazy-expensive stereo gear. Especially gear from one of the few premium hi-fi brands of the 20th century still left on the planet: McIntosh. Back in the day, you had to have a McIntosh rig if you were serious about music (Just ask your dad). Well, the brand with the famous blue and green blinkenlights is still very much alive, and it has birthed a new turntable. The McIntosh MT5 turntable caresses every single groove of your precious vinyl. And for the asking price of $6,500, you should expect your records to receive some extra pampering. Using some finely tuned noise-suppression technology, the MT-5 will let you hear all the nuances of your favorite records without introducing any extra rumbles or vibrations into the audio signal. The silicon acrylic platter is both massive and stable, weighing five pounds and measuring one and one-half inches thick. It\u2019s suspended magnetically and driven by a high-end Swiss-made motor that uses two opposing neodymium magnets. By floating the platter with magnetic force instead of using ball bearings at the base, low-end rumble is all but eliminated. It\u2019s also one less part to wear down. Even cooler is the detail that everyone can appreciate: The platter glows the same McIntosh-flavored bright blue-green as the front glass panel. The custom tone arm is also stabilized by magnets. The anti-skating feature (something common to all turntables) applies a counter-force to suppress the arm\u2019s natural desire to swing toward the middle of the album. But since the McIntosh\u2019s tonearm does it by way of magnets, it further reduces any motor noises or additional sounds that could creep into the audio signal and alter the sounds being pulled from the record. What you end up with is a turntable that spins silently and sounds incredible. But all the craftsmanship required to deliver a pure audio signal will cost you a heap \u2014 probably more than you laid out for your first car. At $6,500, the MT5 isn\u2019t the turntable you\u2019d want to hook up to your $250 soundbar. But if you\u2019re really serious about sound, and maybe you\u2019ve recently won the lottery, this is one of the best ways to listen to vinyl.

When the stock market sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring on the day of the IPO, one thing was clear to me about Tesla: branding was everything . Now that Tesla has started making its second car at scale, it has delivered a quarter profit for the first time , and its shares have traded at a high of almost $195 per share, branding is still everything for Tesla. That\u2019s why the viral video of one of Tesla\u2019s Model S cars burning could be an actual problem for Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Model S has been rated as the safest car out there by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model S that\u2019s shown in the video in flames hit some metal debris on a freeway and Tesla says the fire started in one of the modules in the battery pack. The pack fire, as it turns out , was also difficult to put out. But whether or not an internal combustion car would have had a reaction on par to the Model S when it directly hit some metal debris (or ignited the fuel tank in some way), isn\u2019t really the question. The issue is how much damage can a viral video of a Model S on fire do to Tesla\u2019s valuable brand. Investors reacted to the fiery inferno, and already bubbly stock, and it dropped down to $168 per share at one point, though recovered a bit in the afternoon. It\u2019s now trading around $175 per share. Tesla logo on the Model X Will customers be worried about Model S cars catching on fire after collisions? And will that effect sales at all? An investigation in a couple of fires during safety testing with Chevy\u2019s Volt back in 2011 , seem to contribute to a considerable freeze in Volt sales for awhile. Fires certainly weren\u2019t great publicity for Fisker\u2019s electric cars back when those were on sale. Large companies with diverse product lines can weather branding and publicity issues more easily than startups that have one product on the market. If that one product turns sour, there\u2019s nothing else out there to prop up the brand. But this fire issue could end up being another hurdle Tesla jumps over. Cars get in accidents, and bad things happen in accidents. But the company will likely have to work on its own PR campaign to be transparent but also soothe any worried customers. And the good news is that Tesla has always been particularly adept at PR and marketing, so expect some type of reaction, and soon.", "lede": "Three and a half years ago, then-scrappy electric car startup Tes...", "link": "http://gigaom.com/2013/10/03/the-tesla-fire-and-the-perception-problem/"}, {"author": "Damon Lavrinc", "title": "Please Calm the Hell Down About the Tesla Model S Fire", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:00:00", "content": "The first reported Tesla Model S fire happened in Kent, Washington this week. The driver claims to have run over a large metal object and pulled over when the car alerted him something was wrong. He got out and some time later the front of the EV began burning. The news of the fire and accompanying video sparked hundreds of headlines , and when the New York Stock Exchange closed yesterday, Tesla\u2019s stock had dropped to $180.95. Today, it\u2019s been hovering in the low $170s , and all in, one fire cost Tesla around $600 million in valuation. Between 2006-2010, there have been an average of 152,300 car fires in the U.S. each year . They account for 10 percent of reported fires in the states. But you rarely hear about the Toyota Camry that goes up in flames after something pierces its gas tank. The fact is that on-board energy storage is dangerous. The same fire could have happened to another EV, a traditional internal combustion engine, a hydrogen fuel cell, a compressed air-powered vehicle, or any other fuel that can propel a two-ton hunk of metal, plastic, and rubber down the road at freeway speeds. In a statement released by Tesla, the automaker said that \u201ca Model S collided with a large metallic object in the middle of the road, causing significant damage to the vehicle.\u201d Tesla spokeswoman Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean confirmed to the New York Times that the fire was caused by a \u201cdirect impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 modules within the Model S battery pack,\u201d but because each cell is isolated by design, the fire wouldn\u2019t spread to the rest of the pack. Jarvis-Shean has confirmed to WIRED that it is in possession of the Model S at one of its facilities and is \u201cstudying what happened.\u201d Tesla had a brief brush with a car fires in 2011 when it recalled 439 Roadsters after one fire was reported by an owner and was linked to a 12-volt cable located behind the front headlamp. And Tesla\u2019s not alone. Boeing had a much-publicized fire onboard its new Boeing Dreamliner due to a lithium-ion battery pack , resulting in the grounding of its entire fleet of 787s before a fix was made.

With the fall of the Silk Road \u00a0comes the inevitable expectation that the underbelly of the Internet is somehow cut and something important has been removed like a dark organ of indeterminate worth and function. This is not true. As we well know, the Silk Road was not the first nor the last online market \u2013 even as the Feds celebrate their victory the Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded are angling for the crown \u2013 but the destruction of the Silk Road and, to a degree, the recent comments by the Lavabit founder, show how deeply we trust the Internet with our secrets and how readily it gives them up. We know, now, with certainty that nearly nothing is safe. However, we also know that modern encryption techniques can keep prying eyes out of nearly everything we see or do. Sites like the Silk Road are brought down by carelessness and hubris rather than technical know-how and I\u2019m sure the FBI understands as much about the security systems put in place to protect clients as any other educated amateur. It is at the intersection of human frailty and rock-hard encryption that we find ourselves at a crossroads. The great machines can keep enemies at bay as long as the gatekeeper remembers to close the door. Can we trust the cloud and can we trust anonymous services to truly keep us anonymous? Yes. However, the caveat is that when that trust is broken, it is broken catastrophically, taking down a swathe of the Internet with it. One part of the Silk Road fallout that I found particularly interesting was the site\u2019s seemingly apocryphal ability to jettison deposited Bitcoin back to the owners in the event of a raid. While this behavior hasn\u2019t been documented \u2013 it\u2019s all rumor right now \u2013 it would be an amazing solution for future systems. By learning from the mistakes of Ulbricht and the like, we can build stronger and better systems for the dissemination of information. While I don\u2019t support what went on on the Silk Road \u2013 the hacking services and illegal gun trading alone made it more like the Wild West than Utopia, not to mention the alleged murder-for-hire plots \u2013 I do support its right to exist. No government should be able to shut down a conglomeration of like-minded people who wish to do business anonymously. We cannot judge the pot dealer or the LSD buyer any more than they can judge our habits and predilections. The morality of this can be debated but the right to an anonymous exchange cannot. The Silk Road isn\u2019t dead. The FBI knows that, Ulbricht knows it, the users know it. Just as the death of Napster didn\u2019t stop the trafficking in downloaded music, this will not stop the trafficking in Bitcoin. Someone with a similar bent will build another Silk Road and another, eventually creating a machine that can bar the door without the gatekeeper\u2019s intervention. Then, it seems, we\u2019ll simply have to deal with a machine that refuses us entry because of our foibles and foolishness. The destruction of the Silk Road will teach the authorities a thing or two about Bitcoin and encryption but it will teach future Dread Pirate Roberts important lessons in evasion and obfuscation.", "lede": "After Silk\u00a0Road The Internet routes around damage. With the fall ...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/after-silk-road/"}, {"author": "Arik Hesseldahl", "title": "Silk Road Bust Raises Profile of So-Called \"Dark Web\"", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:56:04", "content": "A Large Evil Corporation Yesterday\u2019s bust of the man the FBI said is the operator of Silk Road , a secretive online marketplace for illegal drugs and various sketchy services, has brought some new attention on the \u201cDark Web.\u201d So what the heck is the Dark Web, a.k.a. the Deep Web, a.k.a. the Hidden Web, and to the extent that you would want to, how does one access it? Basically it\u2019s a network of websites that are hosted on a network reachable only by people who use Tor, which stands for The Onion Router. You can read about it here . Tor\u2019s origins lie in a project at the U.S. Naval Academy , and the point then was research into new ways of protecting government communications from the encroachments of hackers and spies. Here\u2019s how I understand how it works: When using a Tor-enabled browser, the traffic between your computer and the server that hosts the website you\u2019re visiting travels through a randomized network of nodes that comprise the Tor network. No single link in the traffic chain can be used to link back to you, making it a pretty good tool for staying anonymous (when used properly). In time, the research project moved to the open-source community, and now software that enables use of the Tor network is freely available to anyone: Bad guys selling drugs and guns, political activists trying to obfuscate their communications from a repressive government, or police doing surveillance work. Here\u2019s a screen grab of the Tor network I used today, which was created using a program called Vidalia. Today I downloaded a Tor Browser Bundle that contains both Vidalia, which sets up the network, and a tweaked version of the Firefox Web browser. You can find versions that work for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, several of which are customized for different languages, here . After installing, I had what I was told was an anonymized connection to the Web \u2014 that is, the conventional Web. \u201cCongratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor,\u201d a welcome page said. I could search Google for something to help me carry out a criminal act or post a message on some forum without having to worry about any of it ever being traced back to me. In practice, using a browser in this manner is slower than you\u2019re probably used to. All that extra traffic to obfuscate your actual IP address and location takes its toll on the experience. So don\u2019t expect the same zippy Web you\u2019d likely enjoy without all the Tor infrastructure. Otherwise, it was just like using a conventional browser. But here\u2019s where the Dark Web comes in. That same cloak of anonymity that works for an individual browser also works for someone who wants to host a website. There is a pseudo top-level domain known as .onion that is not part of the global domain name registry but that works with Tor-enabled browsers. There\u2019s a Wikipedia article here that gets into more of the technical nitty gritty if you\u2019re interested, but the main thing to know is that these addresses are weird, hard to memorize and probably change regularly, so your mileage may vary. For example, the old address of Silk Road was http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion. (And if you\u2019re still a little behind the curve on what the whole deal was with Silk Road, it\u2019s worth reading Adrian Chen\u2019s piece about it for Kotaku.com from 2011 .) So I went looking around to see what I could find on the Dark Web. My first stop was a site called TorLinks that is a list of sites operating in the .onion domain space. There I found links for what appeared to be a bit of a seedy and primitive underbelly of the Internet. But at the same time, when you look at them, it\u2019s hard not to imagine that the whole thing is some kind of put-on. Topping the list were \u201cfinancial services,\u201d or sites advertising services related to Bitcoin , the untraceable digital currency that is apparently the coin of the realm in this corner of the Internet. I also found working links to two sites offering counterfeit currency: One offered $5,000 worth of fake American $50 bills for the Bitcoin equivalent of $2,000; another offered 6,000 fake euro notes in 50 euro denominations for 1,900 euro worth of Bitcoin. There\u2019s also a \u201cservices\u201d section. One site advertises a \u201crent-a-hacker\u201d service. Another sells fake passports and ID cards. It turns out that Ross Ulbricht, the 29-year-old San Francisco man whom the FBI arrested for operating the Silk Road site, had attracted the attention of the Department of Homeland Security when he ordered a bunch of fake IDs delivered to his home. There\u2019s even a site offering contract killings in the U.S., Canada and the European Union. The going rate: $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in the U.S. and Canada, $12,000 in Europe. And yes, it totally looked like a put-on. But then, what do I know? You\u2019ll just have to find out for yourselves, but you can probably imagine what\u2019s there: Guns, ammo, drugs, porn, stolen credit card numbers, etc. There are links to numerous message forums dedicated to revolutionary politics and wacky conspiracy theories. You get the idea. It reminded me of the early 1990s-era Internet, before the Web itself was mainstream, but not in a good way. There\u2019s also a search engine called Torch that claims to have indexed 117,367 pages in the .onion space. Some searches I did worked, some timed out. Again, your mileage may vary. After a couple hours of exploration I got thoroughly bored. You probably will, too.

Ross William Ulbricht ordered the hit against an employee who took delivery of a kilogram of cocaine valued at $27,000, according to a superseding indictment filed in federal court in Maryland . Shortly after receipt, the employee came under suspicion of stealing from other Silk Road members after he was arrested by law enforcement authorities, prosecutors said. Communicating with an undercover law enforcement agent posing as a drug smuggler, Dread Pirate Roberts\u2014the online moniker prosecutors say Ulbricht used as leader of Silk Road\u2014first asked that the suspected employee be beaten and forced to return the stolen Bitcoins. Soon, the indictment alleged, the kingpin changed his mind. \"Can you change the order to execute rather than torture?\" Ulbricht allegedly asked in January. The employee\u2014who prosecutors said had access to private messages sent by all Silk Road users including its boss\u2014\"was on the inside for a while, and now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info.\" Dread Pirate Roberts, who agreed to pay $40,000 in advance and another $40,000 when the hit was completed, said that he had \"never killed before, but it is the right move in this case,\" the indictment added. On February 4, Dread Pirate Roberts allegedly transferred $40,000 into a bank account controlled by the undercover agent. On March 1, Dread Pirate Roberts had the remainder deposited into the account after he received a staged photo that purported to depict the body of the employee who had died of asphyxiation and heart rupture after being tortured. \"I'm pissed I had to kill him ... but what's done is done,\" Dread Pirate Roberts allegedly wrote after receiving the image. \"I just can't believe he was so stupid. I just wish more people had some integrity.\" \u201cThis kind of behavior is unforgivable to me\u201d The indictment isn't the first court document to level chilling murder-for-hire allegations against Ulbricht. A separate 39-page criminal complaint claims that two months later Ulbricht ordered a $150,000 hit on a Silk Road user known as FriendlyChemist. The murder was ordered after FriendlyChemist hacked into the computer of a large Silk Road drug dealer and provided Ulbricht with a sample of usernames, addresses, and order information to prove it. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the data unless he was paid $500,000. \"This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me,\" Ulbricht told a Silk Road user named redandwhite, according to the complaint. \"Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.\" Referring to the hit, he went on to say \"it doesn't have to be clean.\" There is no evidence the hit was ever carried out. Authorities in White Rock, British Columbia, where Dread Pirate Roberts said FriendlyChemist lived with a wife and three children, have no record of a homicide occurring on March 31, the date redandwhite told Dread Pirate Roberts the man was executed. Ulbricht is scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday.

Concerned by reports about a wide-open marketplace operating as a kind of stoner\u2019s Amazon, the two senators demanded action. The Silk Road kept chugging along, but the senators\u2019 June 8, 2011 letter had an immediate effect somewhere else: in the world of Bitcoin, the digital currency that helps drive the Silk Road. Bitcoin prices promptly went over a cliff, dropping by two-thirds over the next three days. And they kept drifting downwards for months after that. The plunge seemed to confirm that the fates of the Silk Road and Bitcoin were intertwined. Nobody really knew how big a part of the Bitcoin economy the Silk Road really played. But then the feds shuttered the Silk Road this past Wednesday, and now it\u2019s pretty clear, thanks to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Christopher Tarbell, the special agent who signed the complaint against alleged Silk Road mastermind, Ross Ulbricht. From February 2011 to July 2013, there were 1.2 million transactions on the site, accounting for 9.5 million bitcoins. That\u2019s about 4 percent of the 225 million bitcoin transactions that happened on Bitcoin\u2019s public block chain over the same period. The marketplace connected about 150,000 buyer accounts with just under 4,000 sellers. That means that the Silk Road was a very big player in the Bitcoin world, but maybe not the giant that some suspected it was . The relationship between Bitcoin and Ulbricht is clearer too, thanks to court documents that depict Ulbricht as a fan of Austrian Economic Theory and serious Bitcoin trader. According to prosecutors, Ulbricht was \u201cAltoid,\u2019 a frequent poster to Bitcoin forums. Altoid often boasted about buying low and selling high in Bitcoin exchanges. And when Silk Road launched, bitcoin was its only method of payment. Since that time, legitimate bitcoin use has grown, and the bitcoin economy has diversified. There\u2019s still a lot of gambling and speculation. But now you can buy groceries or electronics or cupcakes, or even pay for a cab with bitcoins Although bitcoin took a big drop on the news of the Silk Road bust this Wednesday, it bounced back pretty quickly. So while bitcoins were down 66 percent two years ago on the mere mention of a Silk Road closure, when the F.B.I. finally came knocking, it only bashed the digital currency by about 7 percent. That\u2019s not much worse than a typical day for bitcoin, which has moved about 2.7 percent per day, on average, since it had its big run-up this past spring, according to data compiled by Bitcoin analysis site, The Genesis Block, which has posted an interesting analysis of the relationship between bitcoin and the Silk Road . \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is there\u2019s a huge shift towards this legitimate economy,\u201d says Greg Schvey the Genesis Block\u2019s head of research. In fact, the feds would probably have had a harder time investigating the Silk Road if it had been a cash-based network, says Patrick Murck, a lawyer for the Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit group that is working to steer bitcoin into the mainstream. \u201cIt highlights some things that we\u2019ve been saying all along,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t this magical anonymous currency that helps people with illegal activity.\u201d", "lede": "Two years ago, Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchi...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/10/silk_road/"}]}, {"cluster": 1, "articles": [{"author": "None", "title": "Yahoo, Singapore Press Holdings Settle Copyright Suit", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-01 03:12:23", "content": "Answers allows you to tap the knowledge of Community members.

GoPro's New Cameras Are Smaller, Speedier", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 20:09:00", "content": "Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc GoPro didn\u2019t need to radically reinvent its Hero cameras to maintain top-dog status at the summit of action-camera mountain. And so it didn\u2019t. The new GoPro Hero3+ cameras add a few improvements to the already-excellent Hero3 lineup, and although the changes are conservative, they\u2019re welcome. The new Hero3+ lineup is smaller, lighter, and has a longer-lasting battery than last year\u2019s Hero3. In short: The new Hero3+ lineup is smaller (GoPro says 20 percent smaller, but there are no dimensions listed on the company\u2019s site), lighter (20 percent is quoted again, but the Hero3+ has the same 2.6 oz. weight listed as its predecessor), and has a longer-lasting battery than last year\u2019s Hero3. GoPro says the camera\u2019s battery life has been increased by 30 percent, which would put it at about 1.5 to 2 hours per charge instead of 1 to 1.5 hours. Functionally, there\u2019s not a lot different. That\u2019s largely a good thing. Built-in Wi-Fi is included in all the new models, and the highest-end Black Edition comes bundled with its own remote. According to the company, interaction with the GoPro mobile app and streaming video to devices are speedier with the new cameras too. Other than that, they have the same respectable F2.8 aperture and fixed focal length as the last generation, but GoPro is touting the enhanced sharpness of the new optics. The Black Edition cameras also boast a mode that automatically optimizes exposure in low-light situations. And, of course, the cameras are still practically everything-proof: They\u2019re waterproof down to 131 feet, and they can handle being pilloried by waves and bears . Like its predecessor, the highest-end Hero3+ Black Edition shoots 4K video footage (3840 x 2160), but that feature isn\u2019t as exciting as it sounds. A maximum capture rate of 15 frames per second essentially makes the 4K moot; video may look more detailed, but 15fps is choppy as hell. It\u2019s a head-scratching limitation as the Hero3+ Black Edition can shoot 12-megapixel stills at 30fps. If 4K footage is basically a string of 8-megapixel stills strung together, shouldn\u2019t 4K at 30fps be achievable with the same camera? I\u2019m no scientist, but it seems like it. Much more exciting is the fact that in plain old 1080p mode, the Hero 3+ lineup captures at a smooth 60fps. That\u2019s not exactly new either \u2014 the Hero3 Black Edition did that as well. All the Hero3+ models also record high-speed/super-slow-motion 720p video at 120fps and 640 x 480 resolution video at 240fps. There are three variations in the new GoPro Hero3+ lineup. The Hero3+ Black Edition ($400) is the flagship model, with a 12-megapixel sensor, 4K video capture capabilities, the new low-light mode, and a remote. The identically priced Hero3+ Black Edition Surf is the same camera with surf mounts included. And the Hero3+ Silver Edition drops the price down to $300, but it has a lower-resolution 10-megapixel sensor, a slower burst mode that tops out at 10fps, and it lacks the 4K video mode and bundled remote.", "lede": "Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/10/new-gopro-cameras/"}]}, {"cluster": 2, "articles": [{"author": "Ina Fried", "title": "Facebook Tries to Make Its Home More Inviting by Welcoming Photos From Other Services", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:00:06", "content": "Aiming to make its mobile environment more attractive to Android users, Facebook announced on Thursday that it will start allowing Facebook Home users to see photos and posts from Flickr, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram from their lock screen.

Facebook Facebook revealed plans Wednesday to build a $120 million, 394-unit housing community near its Menlo Park, California, offices. The development, named Anton Menlo, will in part address the housing shortage in the area\u2014employees often inquire about where they should live, according to\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal \u2014but it will also operate as a semi-self-contained community with a number of amenities, among them a very short commute time to work. All but 15 of the apartments will be open to non-Facebook employees, and Facebook is retiring about the community\u2019s prospects as a perk for employees. But the company worked with a San Francisco developer to ape the style of Facebook\u2019s own headquarters in Menlo Park so that, in theory, employees would have a seamless transition between the \u201chome\u201d of work and the \u201chome\u201d of home. Aside from apartments, the area will include a convenience store, sports pub, bike repair shop, yoga studio, pool, cafe, and doggy daycare services. Construction is expected to take at least two years. As the WSJ points out, the community echoes the concept of company towns that had a brief surge of popularity around the start of the twentieth\u00a0century. Business moguls like George Pullman and Andrew Carnegie constructed fully realized towns for their working-class employees to live in, collecting them all in the same place and keeping them convenient to their work sites. Company towns tended to be isolated from other social communities, and workers outside of them would be isolated from each other. Inside the towns there were social events, schools, and even hospitals. But with the convenience came added social pressure : the company towns were a breeding ground for middle-class values\u2014house ownership and families in a close-knit community\u2014that compelled the employees to stay put. Facebook employees are unlikely to be as prone to feeling a need to move up in the world the way steel workers living in Carnegie\u2019s company town might have. The Facebook employee\u2019s burden is more likely to be a home life built to mirror a work life, among colleagues, that extends a long work day even further. And Anton Menlo seems better suited to housing young engineers than families, with only a handful of three-bedroom apartments. Over half of the residences are one-bedrooms. Corporate housing is not an unfamiliar concept for large companies, especially tech companies. Employers like Microsoft and Amazon often provide housing options for their interns and temporary placements for employees who are in town or migrating to the area. But Facebook\u2019s move to provide its employees with a permanent, community-focused housing solution is unusual. Still, big tech companies often become part of the landscape without the company having to build itself apartments. And Facebook's future apartments won't even accommodate that many of the Menlo Park employees, only 10 percent or so. But company housing is a concept that is not really \"done\u201d anymore; the closest modern analogy might be the Foxconn and Pegatron dorms,\u00a0 infamous for housing the factory workers who make Apple products in less-than-desirable conditions, or the Olympic Village that puts up athletes while the games are on. And Facebook's apartments might encourage more of the mixing Steve Jobs targeted when he proposed only two bathrooms for Pixar\u2019s campus. If employees hanging out in luxury common areas with beer and frozen yogurt on the Facebook campus proper are generating good ideas, perhaps half-asleep employees crossing paths while taking the trash out in their pajamas will generate even better ones.", "lede": "A rendering of Anton Menlo, the apartments Facebook plans to buil...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/10/the-houses-that-facebook-built-are-coming-to-san-francisco/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Facebook's Company Town", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:41:10", "content": "Facebook Inc.'s sprawling campus in Menlo Park, Calif., is so full of cushy perks that some employees may never want to go home. Soon, they'll have that option. The social network said this week it is working with a local developer to build a $120 million, 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices. Called Anton Menlo, the 630,000 square-foot rental property will include everything from a sports bar to a doggy day care. Facebook Inc.'s sprawling campus in Menlo Park, Calif., is so full of cushy perks that some employees may never want to go home. Soon, they'll have that option. Reed Albergotti has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Facebook Even in Silicon Valley, where tech companies compete to lure coveted engineers with over-the-top perks and offices that resemble adult playgrounds, Facebook's plan breaks new ground. A Facebook spokeswoman said employee retention wasn't a major factor in the real estate push. \"We're certainly excited to have more housing options closer to campus, but we believe that people work at Facebook because what they do is rewarding and they believe in our mission,\" she said. The Facebook Life Amenities for residents of an apartment building Facebook is constructing near its campus: On-site cafe, convenience store, and sports pub Bicycle repair shop with onsite storage Pet spa with doggy day care, pet walking services, dog park Resort-inspired pool, spa and cabana area Indoor/outdoor wellness, yoga and training facility with personal training Rooftop entertainment deck with three-themed areas Some employees had inquired about places to live near the corporate campus, she said, amid a housing shortage in Menlo Park. Real estate prices are skyrocketing in Silicon Valley, and in San Francisco, up 24% in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the Bay Area, according to DataQuick , a real-estate data firm. The development conjures up memories of so-called \"company towns\" at the turn of the 20th century, where American factory workers lived in communities owned by their employer and were provided housing, health care, law enforcement, church and just about every other service necessary. Spending more time in the clutches of the company sphere isn't necessarily positive. One reason the old company towns eventually disappeared was that they could be overbearing to workers. In the 2013 version, the downside could be unspoken expectations that employees always be working. Facebook's plans are still a far cry from those steelworker and mining company towns from a century ago. Facebook employees aren't expected to work there for their entire lives. And the new development can only house a maximum of about 10% of its Menlo Park employees. But the move speaks to how competition is reshaping the role of corporate culture in the tech industry. \"Silicon Valley is in many ways the antithesis of the company town,\" said Ajay Agrawal, a professor of entrepreneurship at University of Toronto. In today's tech industry, Mr. Agrawal says, employees feel less tied to a company, and more tied to the geographical location and industry. They're more likely to switch companies and collaborate on ideas with people outside their own corporation. One of the downsides of the Silicon Valley model, Mr. Agrawal says, is that if companies believe their employees will likely leave, they won't invest as much in their lives or their development. \"There may be some optimal level between the extreme company town,\" he says, \"and Silicon Valley, where everyone is moving companies.\" To build the housing, Facebook's \"amenities team\" worked with developer St. Anton Partners, a San Francisco Bay area, multi-family real estate developer, to create an environment that mirrors the atmosphere of its corporate campus, where employees are encouraged to mingle and share ideas. The apartments will go for market rates, and a handful will be set aside for low income residents. All but 15 of the units will be open to non-Facebook employees. \"The beauty of this thing is that it's extremely close to our campus,\" said John Tenanes, Facebook's director of real estate and an architect involved in the planning. \"It's a five-minute bike ride\" along a dedicated path that runs along the San Francisco bay, he said. \"You don't even have to put on the brakes.\" One of Facebook's corporate goals is to take care of as many aspects of its employees lives as possible. They don't have to worry about transportation\u2014there's a bus for that. Laundry and dry cleaning? Check. Hairstylists, woodworking classes, bike maintenance. Check. At Facebook, the company's headquarters are supposed to feel more like a college campus than an office. The 56-acre parcel, which it moved to in December 2011, will soon be connected to a new wing, designed by architect Frank Gehry. There is a winding asphalt road that runs through the center of campus where employees glide through on bicycles. Throughout the workday, programmers bond with advertising product developers over free lattes or ice cream, walking around the sculptures and shops, or lounging on sun-drenched grassy knolls and park benches. There is a company game day, where employees run the three-legged race. At night, employees watch movies on a giant, stadium-style outdoor television screen that looms over an open plaza in the middle of campus. Lauryn Hale, a Harvard Business School graduate who was hired by Facebook in 2010, said all the amenities take some stress out of the daily job and allow her to think more creatively. Her favorite thing to do is have a \"walking meeting\" with another employee, but only after grabbing a frozen yogurt at the sweet shop. \"I probably love that too much\" she says.

And, truth be told, the show wasn\u2019t that impressive \u2014 especially if you watched Facebook perform the same fiscal kabuki before it went public last year. It makes a lot of sense to compare Facebook and Twitter. Each company went through about eight years of life before going public \u2014 give or take six months \u2014 and each runs a fast-growing, Silicon Valley-based social network with a global footprint and a heavy dependence on advertising. But financially speaking, there\u2019s a massive gulf between them: One is a reliable profit gusher while the other is an anemic mess. First, credit where credit is due: Twitter is a growth machine. It tripled sales in 2012 and it more than tripled in 2011, and in most of the last six quarters, it grew its active user base by more than 10 percent. More than 65 percent of its advertising appears on mobile devices, a particularly important, fast-growing market. Revenue went from $28 million in 2010 to $317 million last year, giving Twitter significantly better revenue growth in the years leading up to its IPO than Facebook. The trouble is, losses are growing too. They grew to $69 million for the half-year ended June 30 versus $49 million in the same period last year, extending a streak that has seen Twitter lose money in every year of operation it has disclosed. Facebook, in contrast, posted steadily rocketing profits for the three years leading up its S-1. Then there are the absolute numbers, which make Twitter\u2019s little-bird mascot seem apt. By the time Facebook went public, it was posting $1 billion in annual profit on $3.7 billion in revenue from 845 million monthly users. So Twitter is less than one-tenth the company Facebook was when it went public, in terms of sales. It\u2019s less than one-third the company Facebook was in terms of users, claiming 218 million monthlies. And it\u2019s infinitely worse from a bottom-line perspective, since it\u2019s still losing money, $79 million last year. The silver lining there is that losses narrowed between 2011 and 2012. But sadly, they widened this year, by 41 percent in the first six months. It\u2019s also worth noting that Twitter\u2019s user growth is slowing, to 7 percent in the most recent quarter from roughly 10 to 11 percent in prior quarters. But in fairness to the Twitter: Facebook also saw monthly user growth decline in the last quarter contained in its own S-1 \u2014 though this was across a much larger user base. The trouble with Twitter, then, is that its growth seems to have been stunted. Seven and a half years after launch, it\u2019s not only still losing lots of money, but it\u2019s also a small fraction of the company Facebook was eight years after launch. This despite some big advantages, like free content from global mega-celebrities ranging from the presidents of the United States and Russia to stars like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey (to say nothing of Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga). Then there\u2019s the $1.1 billion in venture funding that has been lavished on the company at generous valuations. Twitter\u2019s arrested development makes sense when you consider it ran through three different CEOs while Facebook was run by just one. The optimistic interpretation of Twitter\u2019s much weaker growth story is that over the past three years, under CEO Dick Costolo, the company finally stopped screwing up and put itself on an excellent trajectory that is bound to continue given Twitter\u2019s strong position in mobile and trove of frequently-updated celebrity content. But we\u2019ll find out in the next couple of months whether investors buy that story. Facebook was in a much stronger position \u2014 and its IPO didn\u2019t exactly go well.", "lede": "Twitter finally opened the kimono on Thursday, showing the world ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/twitter-pales-next-to-facebook/"}, {"author": "Cade Metz", "title": "As Twitter IPO Looms, Facebook Turns on Instagram Ads", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 22:04:00", "content": "Instagram will soon begin serving ads.

The movie will enter general release here in the US on October 4. It stars George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as two astronauts having what looks to be a really, really bad day in space. Trailers for the movie show them flying around in their space suits, yelling and crying and dodging debris from exploding satellites and space ships and space stations, all lit by a beautifully rendered and untouchably distant Earth in the background. The director and the studio have taken great pains to recreate the experience of operating in microgravity as accurately as possible. Cuar\u00f3n consulted with NASA astronauts on the particulars of moving in microgravity, and,\u00a0 according to the\u00a0 NY Daily News , the movie's production designers studied thousands of NASA photographs in order to make their vision of space look authentic. When asked how far that commitment to verisimilitude stretched, though, Cuar\u00f3n said that while the movie strives for accuracy, \"it would be disingenuous to say we did it 100 percent, because this is a movie, and we needed to take certain liberties.\" The five minute-plus extended trailer for Gravity . Keep this video handy, because we're going to give it the MST3k treatment in just a moment. There was a five-minute \"extended trailer\" for the movie published last month. It certainly had some gripping visuals, but the longer it went on, the deeper my frown became. I don't claim to be an expert, but the stuff that George Clooney and Sandra Bullock were doing on the screen just didn't look right. Certainly cool, but not right. But this is Ars, and on certain things, we have the hook up . I may not be the expert, but I knew someone who was, and I was going to ask for his official opinion on that extended trailer. The man who makes the plan The last time I talked with Zeb Scoville was at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab , the enormous indoor pool where NASA trains its astronauts on how to spacewalk\u2014or, more properly, how to function during extravehicular activity, or EVA. Scoville is the EVA task group lead at the NBL, and he is responsible for managing the teams that figure out how EVAs work. If an EVA's goal is to replace a part outside the space station, for example, Scoville figures out exactly what the astronauts need to do to replace the part, including the physical movements they need to make. His team is made up of actual NASA flight controllers\u2014during training at the pool, they run the simulations, and during the actual missions, they're manning the consoles in Mission Control. Enlarge / NASA EVA Task Group manager Zeb Scoville, standing in one of the test coordinator control rooms at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory . Visible behind him is the NBL pool. Steven Michael If anyone could shed some light on the accuracy or inaccuracy of Clooney and Bullock's space antics, I figured Scoville would be the man. After a quick call to NASA's press office to arrange some time to talk, we sat down together to watch our way through the trailer. Problem: debris The trailer kicks off with an EVA in progress, and a radio-distorted voice is heard calling for an abort. It becomes clear that the message is directed at some astronauts working on something outside their spacecraft. It looks like they're repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, though it might be something else\u2014for instance, some KEYHOLE reconnaissance satellites are said to share the Hubble's external form factor. Whatever it is, the astronauts are outside with big debris incoming, which means they're in trouble. Enlarge / Screencap from the trailer, showing the start of a giant debris storm. Note the monstrous size of the piece of debris near frame center. Warner Bros Right away, the sheer size of the debris gave us pause. NASA relies on US Strategic Command's big radars to keep constant radar watch on its vehicles, and the chunks shown on-screen are far larger than the minimum size that USSTRATCOM would notice. \"Part of the procedure for getting ready for an EVA would include checking for debris like this, wouldn't it?\" I asked. \"Right\u2014we have a process that's known as a 'certification of EVA readiness,'\" answered Scoville. \"We have the EVA community come together, and they'll present a lot of the technical analysis, and we give our community-wide consensus for a 'go' for the EVA.\" Scoville explained that this analysis includes an assessment of the risk of encountering orbital debris during the EVA. Space isn't empty, especially at the International Space Station's low altitude, and there's always the chance that there'll be a \"conjunction,\" NASA-speak for a potential collision between debris and a vehicle or astronaut. Debris risk is assessed in terms of the potential damage\u2014whether the expected amount of debris could cause a suit leak small enough to survive (which would terminate the mission), or whether it could cause loss of a spacecraft or even astronaut lives. \"The debris they have there is orders of magnitude larger than what you need to create a very catastrophic puncture in a space suit. For comparison, if you have up to about an eighth inch of a hole in an EMU\"\u2014that's Extravehicular Mobility Unit, NASA's acronym for a spacesuit\u2014\"it has emergency oxygen systems which can feed that leak and maintain pressure for about 30 minutes to get you back inside the airlock and repress the airlock. Above about an eighth of an inch, and it can't maintain pressure.\" \"Is there a procedure for what to do if that happens?\" I asked. \"Like, you stick your finger in the hole or try to squeeze the leak closed?\" Scoville responded in the negative because of the spacesuit's many-layered structure. \"On the inside, you have the bladder layer, that actually maintains the pressure of the suit. Beyond that there's the restraint layer, and then you have a neoprene layer, and beyond that the insulation mylar layers for heat rejection, with layers of scrim in between for separation, then the white Ortho-Fabric on the outside. No matter how much you squeeze or push on the outer layer, you're not getting to the inner layer where the bladder is. You wouldn't be able to seal that with a gloved hand with 4.3 pounds of pressure trying to get out of the suit.\" Although an EVA wouldn't be allowed to happen under such conditions, Scoville speaks up here and lets me know that he's actually Googled a plot summary of the movie in preparation for our talk. The debris in Gravity \u00a0actually comes from an event that occurs after the EVA has started. Under such circumstances, the EVA would indeed be terminated, just as is depicted in the trailer. I stow my nerd rage, and we continue. Problem: Clooney's jetpack After the debris zips past, intrepid astronaut George \"The Chin\" Clooney comes in frame, sporting a very cool space jetpack. There's a problem with that backpack, though\u2014nothing like it exists in NASA's active inventory anymore. To me, it looks like Clooney's character is supposed to be wearing a Manned Maneuvering Unit or MMU, a piece of equipment developed for shuttle astronauts to use while repairing satellites. The MMUs worked great, but they weren't used very much, and NASA discontinued flying them in the 1990s. They weren't re-introduced for use on the International Space Station because they're too large and bulky. Enlarge / Clooney's fancy faux-MMU backpack sure does zip him around quick. Unfortunately, it's a wholly fictional piece of hardware. Warner Bros. I point this out to Scoville. \"Yeah,\" he replied. \"It looks not quite like a MMU, but it's something close to it. Those things, the manned maneuvering units, are no longer used. In some of those shots, it looks like a cross between a MMU and a thing we call SAFER , which stands for 'Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue,' which is similar to a MMU\u2014except it doesn't have the same level of redundancy, it's not as large, the joystick is a little different, and it doesn't hold as much gas.\" Enlarge / The SAFER backpack\u2014the closest operational real-world analog to the thing Clooney is wearing. The SAFER backpacks are for astronauts working around the International Space Station, and as the acronym suggests, they're intended to be used in case an astronaut accidentally drifts away from the station. Scoville explains that the little safety jetpack has 24 thrusters powered by the venting of compressed nitrogen gas, and it can accelerate an astronaut up to about 10 feet per second. The SAFER also has a smart gyro-based stabilization system that will automatically stop an astronaut from tumbling. However, these packs aren't intended to be used as the primary means for flitting about outside. The limited amount of delta-v the backpacks can impart is more than enough to stop a drifting astronaut, but the amount of propellant is very limited. SAFER backpacks weren't used on shuttle missions, either: \"On shuttle missions, when they weren't docked to station, they didn't need this\u2014they could just fly the shuttle after them to pick them up if they fell off.\" This provides one explanation for why Clooney's character is wearing a jetpack and Bullock's character isn't\u2014when we meet her in a moment, she's strapped into the foot restraints at the end of the space shuttle's remote manipulator arm, busily working away at repairing the telescope.

Just Go See Gravity</em>", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:30:00", "content": "During a particularly eye-popping scene in the astonishing new space thriller\u00a0 Gravity , I thought I saw my boyfriend, who was sitting next to me in the theater, yawn. For that fraction of a second, I questioned everything I knew about him, our relationship, and most damningly, his taste in movies. When I turned to look, however, I realized that his jaw was simply hanging open. It\u2019s a far more appropriate response to one of the most astonishing cinematic spectacles ever created. \u201cHow in the hell did they do that?\u201d we wondered, walking out of the theater later. This is the sort of movie that inspires those kinds of conversations, that kind of awe. And if you\u2019re the sort of movie viewer who would rather walk into an extremely memorable movie experience completely cold, then do yourself a favor: Stop reading now, buy a ticket to see the movie this weekend in 3-D (IMAX preferred), and get ready to have your mind blown. Minor spoilers for Gravity follow. The movie is a sort of minimalist mobile, hung over the crib of the Earth, with only three things dangling from it: astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer on her first mission in space; Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), a veteran rocket jockey; and \u2026 some other guy. (Technically his name is Shariff, but let\u2019s just say that he gets plucked off the mobile a little bit too early for it to really matter.) After a deadly debris field \u2014 damn those Russians! \u2014 catastrophically damages the satellite and cuts off all communication between the astronauts and Earth, we\u2019re left with two actors in a one-room play, albeit a room the size of the universe. The story is as small and personal as the setting is vast, and the movie\u2019s sense of space somehow captures those contradictions of scale: the agoraphobia of darkness extending infinitely in every direction, and the claustrophobia of being sealed inside tiny suits and shuttles that are the only insulation from instant death. Space, as the opening sequence of the movie reminds us, is a place where the temperature can vacillate between -260 to 150 degrees, where there is no oxygen, where there is no sound. In short, \u201clife is impossible.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment shared on multiple levels by Dr. Stone, a quiet, withdrawn woman who is difficult to love at the beginning of the movie, particularly compared to the jocular, talkative Kowalski, who jets around her like a kid on a zero-G rope swing, telling off-color stories about ex-wives and playing country music. It\u2019s not long before we learn the reason for her stoicism: She lost a daughter in a terrifyingly mundane accident \u2014 falling down on the playground \u2014 and has never quite recovered from it. Stone mentions there\u2019s no one who would mourn her if she didn\u2019t come back, and we get the sense that she detached from the world long before she started floating above it. It\u2019s hard to imagine a better metaphor for depression, or for grief: untethered and abandoned in a void so large that it boggles the mind , or simply shuts it down.\u00a0 You can tell, at times, that the idea of drifting away seems tempting to Stone, as if she could simply fall asleep in the infinite, inky snowbank of space. Much of the film is Stone\u2019s struggle, both literally and figuratively, between when to hold on to things and when to let them go. For her part,\u00a0Bullock acts the hell out of it, carrying almost the entire film on her shoulders in a transformative performance that seems destined for award nominations. The characters spend a lot of time talking to themselves \u2014 and to each other \u2014 to literally\u00a0fill the space, the way you turn on the TV in an empty house to feel like you\u2019re not alone. If there\u2019s any weakness in the film, it\u2019s the on-the-nose dialogue that sometimes emerges from these monologues, which end up simply telling us what the film has already shown us. Still, this thematic rib-poking doesn\u2019t meaningfully detract from either the film\u2019s emotional impact or its staggering visual grandeur. If ever there were a movie to see in 3-D, this is it. Where other 3-D films delight in shoving objects unexpectedly towards the viewer, here it\u2019s far more powerful to see them falling away. With no gravity to anchor them, every character is just one firm shove away from hurtling into space forever, with nothing to slow them down. There\u2019s a devastating long shot where something essential drifts away from Dr. Stone, receding from an image that fills the screen to a tiny speck. And in 3-D you feel every inch of the distance, growing slowly along with the sickening realization that it has been lost forever. The zero-G environment is remarkable, and the way characters move through it feels alternately weightless and heavy, like moving through liquid; we see the lithe Bullock glide through the portals of a space station with the grace of a swimmer, while outside in space cables and cords splay out as languid as seaweed before snapping back like whips. There\u2019s a breath and pulse to all of it, a rhythm that feels cyclical. Even the debris field \u2014 the primary antagonist, aside from the deadliness of space \u2014 has its own deadly orbit, reappearing to terrorize our heroes every 90 minutes as it hurtles its way around the earth. Be warned: For all its dazzling cinematography, this is a tense, anxious thriller; once it begins, there\u2019s little relief until the credits start rolling. If you have dreams later about Gravity , chances are they\u2019ll be nightmares about fumbling, endlessly and fruitlessly for handholds on spacecraft that you can never quite grasp before you tumble into nothingness. But rarely has that nightmare been so gorgeous to behold, or so unexpectedly life-affirming. I left the theater feeling like I\u2019d witnessed something so incredible that I wanted to tug on the sleeve of the person next to me and say, \u201cDid you see that?!\u201d If you\u2019d like to have an answer to that question when everyone is talking about Gravity come Monday, then I say to you again: Go buy a ticket. There are many things to say about this film, but the tl;dr version is this is a movie that demands to be beheld.

There\u2019s\u00a0 halted food safety inspections , kids with cancer who\u00a0 won\u2019t be able to join \u00a0clinical drug trials, and\u00a0 suspension of disease outbreak monitoring . Conservation studies have been thrown into disarray \u00a0and at least one NASA Mars mission is at risk of being delayed for years. But one area where the devastating effects aren\u2019t getting much public attention is basic biomedical research. What\u2019s happening to the thousands of researchers and billions of dollars dedicated to understanding human disease and development? I talked to a government biomedical scientist about the shutdown\u2019s effect. Because the scientist was instructed not to speak with the media, this person will remain anonymous. Below is an edited version of what the scientist told me. I\u2019m sitting here, the only person in the whole wing of this building, alone. The lights are off in my office. It\u2019s very depressing. It\u2019s very sad. I don\u2019t think the public realizes the devastating impact that this has on scientific research. Scientific research is not like turning on and off an assembly line. Experiments are frequently long-term and complicated. They involve specific treatments and specific times. You can\u2019t just stop and restart it. You\u2019ve probably just destroyed the experiment. You also can\u2019t necessarily recover. You can\u2019t begin an experiment all over again. If you do, you\u2019ll be set back months \u2014 if there\u2019s even time and personnel to do it. But often, science moves rapidly, times change, and you can\u2019t re-initiate the experiments. It\u2019s an enormous loss to scientific research, an enormous loss of time and personnel. Scientists are hardworking people. They work long hours, on weekends, and they do that because it\u2019s necessary. The schedules they follow aren\u2019t like an industrial plant\u2019s. If you interrupt them, they can\u2019t pick up and start again. It\u2019s an enormous waste of money and resources to interrupt this and have it abandoned. Unlike most other government medical researchers, this scientist has been allowed to visit the laboratory to feed rodents used in research by the scientist\u2019s group. Many if not most of the rodents will soon be euthanized. It\u2019s not a matter of feeding the animals and cleaning their cages. These animals used for research are used in intricate experiments, involving treatments and collection of data performed by hundreds of individual scientists with each project. An animal caretaker can\u2019t continue that. Given that, you can imagine what has to happen. You cannot maintain colonies for no reason. It\u2019s very expensive \u2014 and if they\u2019re useless for research, what are you going to do? And mice and rats breed like crazy. An exponential expansion of the population that will rapidly fill all the cages. Every lab I know already works to maximum capacity. You can\u2019t leave animals for somebody to feed and water. So every time a shutdown happens, measures have to be taken. The politicians might talk gloatingly about how they averted a shutdown five minutes to midnight, like the last one \u2014 but that\u2019s too late. The damage has already been done. All our preparations have to be done well in advance. As soon as you find out there\u2019s only going to be caretakers for the animals, the experiments have to end. We do our experiments 24/7 in my lab. You have to harvest at particular times. Experiments need to be processed and manipulated. A week\u2019s interruption would mean wasting and interrupting a lot of material \u2014 but what we\u2019re given is a shutdown of an indefinite period. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. We try to maintain as much life and resources as possible, but there\u2019s a lot that can\u2019t be maintained given an indefinite shutdown. While talking about the imminent death of the animals, remorse enters the scientist\u2019s voice. I\u2019m surprised: After all, the rodents are going to be killed during the experiments anyways, right? We only take the life of an animal if it\u2019s justified to provide new insight that will lead to basic understandings in science, or new treatments in human disease. We understand and appreciate that. We don\u2019t do it lightly. We do it deliberately. There\u2019s a difference between using an animal to obtain knowledge of human disease, and just having to engage in a mercy killing for no outcome, and with an enormous loss to science and to resources. It\u2019s a waste of money, a waste of time, a waste of people, a waste of animals. I ask if the scientist is being paid. I\u2019m not being paid. They\u2019ve promised to compensate me when this ends. Here I am in a dark building. I walk by the snack shop that this family runs, that everybody here in the building uses. They\u2019re an immigrant family, hardworking, they take the bus to work. They\u2019re here before anybody else and leave at the end of the day. Now that door is closed. That family is getting no money. They\u2019re not going to recover it. They\u2019re not going to be paid for the lost income. These are hardworking people that need the money. And it\u2019s all lost because of politicians engaging in this political terrorism. Democracy means that you\u2019re not always going to get your way. That\u2019s what democracy is. To apply a really loaded term \u2014 but I think it\u2019s appropriate \u2014 those engaged in this, I view theirs as anti-American behavior. It\u2019s ironic that factions with names like Tea Party and Patriot engage in anti-American behavior: shutting down the government because they don\u2019t agree with a vote passed by the majority. And I don\u2019t care what the issue is. We always have our right- and left-wing factions. Nobody ever gets their way. You can\u2019t sabotage the entire government in a democratic society and still have an America. What you end up with is a failed democracy.", "lede": "The federal shutdown\u2019s effects on science and medicine are many. ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/10/government-shutdown-affects-biomedical-research/"}, {"author": "Thomas Lin, Quanta Magazine", "title": "Big Data Is Too Big for Scientists to Handle Alone", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 14:30:00", "content": "Seven years ago, when David Schimel was asked to design an ambitious data project called the National Ecological Observatory Network , it was little more than a National Science Foundation grant. There was no formal organization, no employees, no detailed science plan. Emboldened by advances in remote sensing, data storage and computing power, NEON sought answers to the biggest question in ecology: How do global climate change, land use and biodiversity influence natural and managed ecosystems and the biosphere as a whole? \u201cWe don\u2019t understand that very well,\u201d Schimel said. Splitting his time at first between the new project and his role as a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , Schimel said he was surprised by the magnitude of the challenge, by the \u201csheer number of different measurements required to address the key science questions.\u201d Before any observatories could be erected or staff members hired, decisions had to be made about where to take measurements, what to measure, how to measure it and how to generate meaningful data. Schimel began to explore site options across the country and to assemble NASA-inspired \u201ctiger teams\u201d that could develop rigorous scientific methodologies and data-processing requirements. The final plan called for hiring dozens of scientists with disparate backgrounds; building more than 100 data-collection sites across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico; recording approximately 600 billion raw measurements per year for 30 years; and converting the raw data into more user-friendly \u201cdata products\u201d to be made freely available to scientists and the public. Building the observatory network is projected to take four more years and cost $434 million, and millions more will be needed to cover annual operating expenses. In 2007, Schimel became NEON\u2019s chief scientist and first full-time employee. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in processes at the continental scale for a long time and it\u2019s always been a data-starved activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opportunity to actually design a system to collect the right data at that scale was irresistible.\u201d Across the sciences, similar analyses of large-scale observational or experimental data, dubbed \u201cbig science,\u201d offer insights into many of the greatest mysteries. What is dark matter , and how is it distributed throughout the universe? Does life exist, or is it capable of existing on another planet? What are the connections between genetic markers and disease? How will the Earth\u2019s climate change over the next century and beyond? How do neural networks form thoughts, memories and consciousness? Much of the recent data frenzy \u2014 from the physical and life sciences to the user-generated content aggregated by Google, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 has come in the form of largely unstructured streams of digital potpourri that require new, flexible databases, massive computing power and sophisticated algorithms to wring out bits of meaning from them, said Matt LeMay, a former product manager at the URL shortening and bookmarking service Bitly. But \u201cbig data is not magic,\u201d he cautioned while teaching a database workshop this summer in Lower Manhattan. It doesn\u2019t matter how much data you have if you can\u2019t make sense of it. For projects like NEON, interpreting the data is a complicated business. Early on, the team realized that its data, while mid-size compared with the largest physics and biology projects, would be big in complexity. \u201cNEON\u2019s contribution to big data is not in its volume,\u201d said Steve Berukoff , the project\u2019s assistant director for data products. \u201cIt\u2019s in the heterogeneity and spatial and temporal distribution of data.\u201d Unlike the roughly 20 critical measurements in climate science or the vast but relatively structured data in particle physics, NEON will have more than 500 quantities to keep track of, from temperature, soil and water measurements to insect, bird, mammal and microbial samples to remote sensing and aerial imaging. Much of the data is highly unstructured and difficult to parse \u2014 for example, taxonomic names and behavioral observations, which are sometimes subject to debate and revision. And, as daunting as the looming data crush appears from a technical perspective, some of the greatest challenges are wholly nontechnical. Many researchers say the big science projects and analytical tools of the future can succeed only with the right mix of science, statistics, computer science, pure mathematics and deft leadership. In the big data age of distributed computing \u2014 in which enormously complex tasks are divided across a network of computers \u2014 the question remains: How should distributed science be conducted across a network of researchers? \u201cMachines are not going to organize data science research,\u201d said Bin Yu , a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, who works on high-dimensional data problems. \u201cHumans have to lead the way.\u201d But, she said, \u201cno one knows who is leading data science right now.\u201d Describing universities as \u201cvery siloed,\u201d Yu said the goal is not merely interdisciplinary research, but rather to reach a state of \u201ctransdisciplinary research,\u201d without walls or divisions. Big science projects \u201ccan\u2019t be dealt with by one person,\u201d said Jack Gilbert , an environmental microbiologist at Argonne National Laboratory who has helped NEON develop standards for analyzing soil samples and plans to utilize its data when it comes online. \u201cWe need to work together. It\u2019s too big a problem.\u201d Big \u2018Bad\u2019 Science Ecology has traditionally involved small, localized studies that examine how organisms interact with their surroundings. But in grappling with the foundational questions on a regional or global scale, the microsystems approach brings to mind the old Indian parable in which six blind men feel different parts of an elephant to determine its shape. In John Godfrey Saxe\u2019s popular retelling, the men come to wildly divergent conclusions, that the elephant is like a wall, spear, snake, tree, fan or rope. \u201cWe were missing key pieces of information and not getting the big picture,\u201d said Andrea Thorpe , 37, a plant ecologist who pursued smaller-scale studies on invasive species before joining NEON last year as its assistant director for terrestrial ecology. Although smaller studies provide much-needed depth and detail at a local level, they also tend to be limited to a specific set of questions and reflect an investigator\u2019s particular methodology, which can make results more difficult to reproduce or reconcile with broader models. \u2018There are some really big impacts happening to the ecosystem that can\u2019t be studied with short-term, smaller studies.\u2019 \u201cYou can\u2019t escape the fact that there are some really big impacts happening to the ecosystem that can\u2019t be studied with short-term, smaller studies,\u201d Thorpe said. Macrosystems, or \u201cbig,\u201d ecology, as Schimel calls it, becomes possible with standardized, broad-scale data. He says that having large, rich data sets enables scientists to incorporate the complexity and variability of the real world into their models of large-scale phenomena, rather than to \u201cpeanut butter over\u201d them with simplified models. Ecologists first delved into the world of big data about 50 years ago with the International Biological Program, which cut across scientific disciplines and involved dozens of countries in an attempt to model large-scale systems. It is beloved by the pioneers and supporters of international partnerships but was roundly criticized at the time by traditional biologists who were skeptical of big data modeling and titanic collaborations. Although the project paved the way for newer collaborative efforts like NEON, some of the criticisms have lingered. In 1969, Thomas Rosswall joined the Swedish tundra biome section of the IBP as a 28-year-old microbial ecologist. At a time when little coordinated research existed in biology, he said, the challenge was to get the microbiologists to work with the botanists and the hydrologists to work with the meteorologists. And the Cold War meant that outside scientists couldn\u2019t visit the Russian sites. Instead, the Russians shared pictures of their work. Rosswall, a former executive director of the International Council for Science who is now retired, said his IBP work shaped his career as an international scientist. The tundra project was a particularly close-knit community, he said. \u201cWe were also young and rather na\u00efve, and maybe that was good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have preconceived ideas on how things should be done.\u201d Pages: 1 2 View All", "lede": "Seven years ago, when David Schimel was asked to design an ambiti...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/10/big-data-science/"}]}, {"cluster": 5, "articles": [{"author": "Alex Williams", "title": "Cotap Launches Mobile Messaging Service For The Business World", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 05:20:41", "content": "Cotap Launches Mobile Messaging Service For The Business\u00a0World Cotap , a startup that\u00a0strives\u00a0to be the GroupMe of the business world, has launched its mobile\u00a0 messaging service designed for corporate customers. The service, available as an iPhone app and later on Android, allows users to invite people into managed, group conversations.

With Cotap, a\u00a0customer invites one or more people who exchange messages via SMS or by email if they do not have an account.

Founded by Jim Patterson, Yammer\u2019s former chief product officer, the service\u00a0 employs a similar model to the enterprise social network that sold to\u00a0 Microsoft \u00a0for $1.2 billion. Cotap is free but requires a contract if the company wants to adopt the platform. The model obviously worked for Yammer, but it was confrontational. Yammer made it an all-or-nothing proposition: Pay up for control over the service or don\u2019t, and employees will continue to get access to the service with permission or not. Cotap wants to take a more conciliatory\u00a0approach to help IT see the value in the service. Patterson said its premium\u00a0features will include data export, data retention and monitoring. If a company doesn\u2019t buy, its users can continue to use the basic service for free, which is the same model as Yammer and Box. Patterson said Cotap will focus\u00a0more on selling value to companies rather than ownership of the data. \u201cLong term, we don\u2019t see\u00a0Cotap\u00a0as an IT tool, so our primary premium features won\u2019t be IT tools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the long-term value of\u00a0Cotap\u00a0being around employee engagement, which is the priority of C-level execs or HR.\u201d Launch Date: May 2013 Funding: $5.5M CoTap\u2019s mission is to help people work together better by simplifying mobile communication in the workplace.

Image: Dillenburger Architects Michael Hansmeyer and Benjamin Dillenburger are passionate about pushing the limits of 3-D design, and their latest algorithmically generated project, a room called Digital Grotesque , is composed of 260 million surfaces and 30 billion voxels, and takes up 78 gigabytes of hard drive space. Just rendering images of the stunningly detailed, 170-square-foot space took weeks, and when they searched for a 3-D printer that could produce their cavernous creation, none of the popular plastic printers could handle the load. CAD files in hand, the designer duo set out in search of a machine that could accommodate their architectural ambitions and found a solution in a 3-D printer typically used to manufacture engine blocks. Larger than most cars, Voxeljet\u2019s 3-D printers build models using silica sand and are capable of producing sandy sculptures that weigh up to 12 tons while maintaining a barely perceivable 0.13 millimeter layer thickness. These machines usually fabricate sand molds for investment casting. Their output is seen as a disposable byproduct, but Hansmeyer and Dillenburger coated the gritty components with a strengthening resin and treated them like giant sandstone bricks. \u201cThe limiting factor for us was no longer the dimensions of the printable space,\u201d says Hansmeyer, \u201cbut the logistics of transporting and assembling the pieces.\u201d It is an architecture that would otherwise be undrawable, and even inconceivable. It took a year for the designers to find the right tools and fabricating the building blocks took over a month, but the massive, 9-foot tall, industrial-strength sand castle was assembled in just under a day with the help of a gantry crane and team of volunteers. The physical results are stunning, but for Hansmeyer the design process is equally impressive and was an attempt to visualize the answer to a simple question: \u201cHow could an architecture that is entirely designed by algorithms look?\u201d Digital Grotesque looks like something that could have sprung from Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s drawing board, but the swirling, baroque shapes of the room are actually the results of a few simple equations, and Hansmeyer believes they \u201ccreate an architecture that would otherwise be undrawable, or even inconceivable using traditional means.\u201d Despite its procedural pedigree, Hansmeyer still claims authorship over the design. \u201cThe architect is still very much the designer, not the computer,\u201d he says, but the computational approach does change the creator\u2019s role. Software allows for dozens of potential solutions to emerge which can then be fed back into the system to create more potential designs, but leaves the real skill is in editing the results. \u201cThe architect becomes the cultivator and moderator of these production processes and forfeits direct control of some attributes to gain control over others.\u201d Digital Grotesque is an amazing proof of concept, but Hansmeyer has only laid the cornerstone of what could ultimately be a cathedral built to the glory of computational design. \u201cOne of the most astonishing things, and something we\u2019re still trying to get our head around, is that it costs the exact same amount to 3-D print a plain box as it does to print the most elaborate form conceivable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe costs are the same, and the amount of time required is the same. It is only the outside dimensions that matter, so there is no longer any cost for complexity and no cost for ornament.\u201d Digital Grosteque pushed the limits of laptops and 3-D printer, but the pair of architects have big plans to 3-D print a house with details as fine as grains of sand. \u201cIt will be a house that looks like nothing we can imagine today, and is just within reach!\u201d says Hansmeyer.", "lede": "Dramatic lighting helps catch the 170-square-foot structure's ext...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/design/2013/10/designers-build-industrial-strength-sand-castle-with-3-d-printer/"}]}, {"cluster": 6, "articles": [{"author": "Mark Gurman", "title": "Best Buy giving out $50 gift cards with iPhone 5c purchases through Oct. 7", "feed_title": "9to5Mac", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:45:36", "content": "Best Buy has noted on its website that between today (Thursday) and October 7th (next Monday), it will be offering $50 gift cards with iPhone 5c purchases.

Photo: Raw Edges Necessity is the mother of invention, but a screaming toddler also does wonders to get a parent\u2019s creative juices flowing. London-based designers Shay Alkalay and Yael Mer run a studio together and are also the proud parents of a restless child who frequently demands bonus bedtime stories in the wee hours of the morning. One sleep deprived night, Mer was balancing his baby, holding a copy of Goodnight Moon , and using his iPhone as a flashlight when he got a bright idea\u2014turn the smartphone into a lightbulb and ensconce it in a little lamp to free up a hand and streamline story time. \u201cIt was a survival situation,\u201d jokes Mer. \u201cThe phone was next to me, I didn\u2019t have a bedside light, and it was hard to hold three things at once.\u201d Mer and Alkalay quickly started sketching up ideas for bedside lamps that would use smartphones as $600 LED lightbulbs. A list of requirements took shape quickly. They wanted a product that could accommodate many kinds of smartphones, a design with no electronics so their creation wouldn\u2019t become obsolete if a company switched up the connector, no specialized apps would be required, and most importantly, it needed to feel like furniture, not a gadget. Mer credits Pixar\u2019s animated lamp mascot as a partial inspiration. Mer credits Pixar\u2019s animated lamp mascot as a partial inspiration.

Mer and Alkalay sketched up a bevy of ideas, some functional and others that were purely fun. One concept was inspired by a slingshot and was intended to be a sculptural statement piece. Another solution used a rubber lampshade to do double duty and hold the phone while dispersing the light. A simple, upright design was inspired by traditional army flashlights and a lamp with a subtle rocking feature rounds out the collection. Plastics and metals are the default design choices for most smartphone accessories, but the designers decided to wrap their iPhones in warm, friendly materials like woods and rubber. \u201cWe designed the object to have character, to be something that will attract you,\u201d says Mer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this project if people didn\u2019t already sleep next to their phones. I\u2019m not crazy about this behavior, but if this is what people are already doing, we should design around it.\u201d The yellow rocking lamp ended up being the favorite of visitors of the London Design Festival where it attracted the attention of manufacturers.

Image: Talia Radford Yes, poking an ear works. Image: Talia Radford Photo booths always seem like a good idea. They\u2019re just sitting there in the corner of a dark, dank bar, waiting for you and four of your friends to cram yourselves into an impossibly tiny space. Most of the time you do because photo booths are fun! But then you realize there\u2019s no way in hell anyone is going to be able to reach the button to actually make the thing work. Photo booths are charming, sure. But they\u2019re also uncomfortable, archaic in their technology and half the time don\u2019t even print your photos. The Thermobooth, on the other hand, is a super smart version of photo booths past. With its geometrical, post-modern look, not only is it a beautiful object, it\u2019s also fail-proof. To make the Thermobooth work, all you need to do is touch the person next to you, and an electric charge triggers the flash, camera and printer. When two people touch skin to skin, the electrical circuit is closed. Designed by Talia Radford of Vienna-based taliaYstudio and artist Jonas Bohatsch , the Thermobooth replaces old photo booth technology with high-tech OLED lights, conductive plates and a thermal printer. The idea originated when Radford was looking for a way to make one of her studio parties more interactive. She called up Bohatsch, who has been working in the media art space for a while, and they hatched up a plan to create a 21st century photo booth. The original set up used at Radford\u2019s party was pretty rudimentary\u2014it was basically just a computer camera with a flash hanging off of it that was connected to a MaKey MaKey and thermal printer. \u201cIt was really ugly\u201d she recalls. But the concept was interesting. Interesting enough for lighting manufacturer OSRAM to help Radford and Bohatsch develop an upgraded version that uses OLED lights, the fancy new lighting technology used in expensive televisions. Radford\u2019s most recent design is more like a photo studio, with an open stage that\u2019s obscured by simple geometric mirrors rising from what Radford describes as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the set-up. These mirrors are actually OLED lights that act as both the flash and a way for users to check their mugs before the camera snaps. When you walk into the Thermobooth (shoes free) you step onto a carpet that has two circular plates. These discs are connected to the booth\u2019s brain through a MaKey MaKey and act as a break in the electrical circuit. So when two people touch skin to skin, the electrical circuit is closed, effectively turning participants into human-sized switch that powers the flash, camera and printer. It\u2019s a clever application of technology, plus it\u2019s a good excuse to take an adorable picture. The photo you get isn\u2019t the highest quality, but the choice to use a thermal printer instead of the glossy, high-tech variety was a deliberate choice. The Thermobooth, Radford says, is\u00a0about impulsiveness\u2014grabbing someone and kissing them, hugging them or even picking their nose (yes, that has happened). \u201cThe quality of the photos it\u2019s not really that great, but then we realized it\u2019s not really about the quality of the photos,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most important thing isn\u2019t the image, but what the image evokes.\u201d", "lede": "The Thermobooth only takes a photo when two people touch.

By comparing the iPhone 5S to an iPhone 5 and also to several real-world tools that the phone replicates with motion sensors (including an actual compass and a spirit level), Gizmodo found that the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer in two separate iPhone 5Ses do indeed appear to be off by a small but consistently measurable amount.

The severity of the problem appears to vary from phone to phone\u2014some posters in a MacRumors forum thread on the topic claim that their phones are off by four or six degrees (instead of two, as with our iPhone 5S and with Gizmodo's), while others report that they no longer had the issue after getting a replacement phone from Apple. The relatively wide range of inaccuracies being reported and the fact that the iPhone 5 and 4S aren't affected point to this being a hardware issue and not a software issue, though without a statement for Apple it's difficult to say for sure. Beyond the inaccuracies in the compass app, the actual real-world impact of this issue is small. While Gizmodo's videos do show that the sensors can cause problems for games if you have the phone resting flat on a table, most people are going to subconsciously adjust the phone to compensate for the slight inaccuracies.

We\u2019ve been receiving several complaints from iPhone users about inaccurate readings from the gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, and other sensor-based features for the device, and today Gizmodo found similar issues with a 5s unit that it tested: We\u2019ve confirmed the new iPhone\u2019s failings on our own.

We were wrong. Gizmodo tested the iPhone\u2019s level, gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer and found that the 5s is off compared to the same tests on an iPhone 5 and 4S. For example, it discovered its 5s unit\u2019s level was reading 2-3 degrees off the 5 and 4S, which also proved to be troublesome for games that rely on the gyroscope, like driving games, for motion controls: The same issue was the case with the compass, measuring around 8-10 degrees different than the iPhone 5, as well as the accelerometer, which Gizmodo says \u201cis registering way more latent motion.\u201d Since all devices tested by Gizmodo and others were running iOS 7, all signs point to a hardware issue with the 5s, but it\u2019s still possible software optimizations could fix how the 5s records data from its sensors.

A couple years ago, Federici was working on his Ph.D. in biological sciences at Cambridge University studying self-organization, the process by which things organize themselves spontaneously and without direction. Like a flock of birds flying together . More specifically, he was using microscopes and a process called fluorescence microscopy to see if he could identify these kinds of patterns on a cellular level. In fluorescence microscopy, scientists shine a particular kind of light at whatever they\u2019re trying to illuminate and then that substance identifies itself by shining a different color or light back. Sometimes researchers will also attach proteins that they know emit a particular kind of light to substances as a kind of identifier. In the non-microscopic world, it\u2019s like using a black light on a stoner poster. Federici grew up with photography as a hobby, so looking through the microscope at all the different colors and patterns he realized that the process was highly visual. He hadn\u2019t seen many images like what he was seeing published for the general public, so he asked for permission from his adviser Jim Haseloff to post the photos on his Flickr site . Today that site is filled with pages and pages of microscopic images, some of which are from his work, while others are just for fun. \u201cMicroscopy is always serious science,\u201d says Federici, who is now a researcher at Pontificia Univerisdad Catolica de Chile. \u201cFor us [in the department at Cambridge] this was something we looked at as outreach. It was a way to bring this scientific data to the general public.\u201d Many of the photos on the site show particular bacteria colonies that were studied for their self-organizing principles. Others are just images of old plants that were used to teach botany at the university over a hundred years ago. Before fluorescence microscopy, scientists used dyes to try and single out certain cells or structures. Those dyes, which sat for decades on the plants, now make for arty images under a microscope. Other photos on the Flickr page include microscopic images of crystals and oil. Federici says there\u2019s still a lot to learn about self-organization so viewers can look forward to more art from him. If or when his colleagues are successful at what they\u2019re chasing in self-organization, they eventually hope to be able to control it through something called synthetic biology, which will be a game-changer. \u201cWe can imagine a future of intelligent material,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, instead of chopping a tree down to make a chair, scientists might eventually be able to control a tree to just grow a chair.\u201d", "lede": "Fernan Federici\u2019s microscopic images of plants, bacteria, and cry...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2013/10/beautiful-microscopic-art-is-also-world-changing-science/"}, {"author": "Jordan Teicher", "title": "This 98-Year-Old Man Spent 13 Years Creating Remarkable Art in MS Paint", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:49:00", "content": "Hal Lasko may be 98 years old, but while many of his peers devote their leisure time to shuffleboard and bridge, he has a very different passion: creating huge works of art pixel by pixel in Microsoft Paint. While most people have long since abandoned MS Paint as an outdated graphics application, Lasko has spent the last 13 years using the program to digitally create works of art, spending up to 10 hours a day on his work. Originally a traditional painter, he switched to MS Paint in 2005 when his vision was impaired by wet macular degeneration, an eye disease that causes blindness in the center of his vision. He has since created more than 150 digital works, though his blindness means he will never be able to view them in their totality. \u201cWhen I started to go blind, I wasn\u2019t able to get the brush quite where I wanted it,\u201d Lasko told WIRED. \u201cSo when I got into the art program on the computer, I appreciated that I could blow it up eight hundred times [larger] and be sure that I was hitting the right spot.\u201d Although he had never used computer graphics software before, Lasko did have experience with artistic design after working as a typographer. He mastered lettering as an apprentice after high school, creating fonts by hand, and learned to paint traditionally on his own. His grandson, Ryan Lasko, initially introduced him to Microsoft Paint, but according to Ryan, that too \u201cis all pretty much self-taught.\u201d Hal\u2019s work has been inspired by artists including Edward Hopper, Charles Burchfield, and Paul Clay; lately, he has come to appreciate impressionism, and experimented with ways to adapt its thin, layered brushstrokes with an 8-bit twist. While he initially didn\u2019t realize that his digital paintings could be printed, he now has a website selling 16\u201d x 20\u201d prints of eight different works; he may soon begin printing on canvas as well. Last July, Ryan, who works as a graphic designer for a New York City software company, teamed with Josh Bogdan, a college friend and San Francisco copywriter, to direct a short documentary called about Hal and his art. The Pixel Painter (above), which runs eight and a half minutes, spends an entire weekend with Hal discussing his love of making art in MS Paint; the shoot included his 97th birthday celebration and the debut of an art exhibit at a senior center where Hal displayed two of his digital paintings. \u201cHe\u2019ll talk to anyone for hours about his artwork,\u201d Bogdan said. \u201cIt\u2019s his passion. He loves to chat, and it takes nothing to get him going.\u201d Asked if he thinks about his paintings a lot, Hal laughed, \u201cthat\u2019s all I do.\u201d\u00a0He says he has \u201cenjoyed every minute\u201d of his work, including having his story told as a documentary. Since the video was posted on Vimeo last month, it has since tallied 1.2 million plays, reaching viewers in Poland, China, and South Korea. \u201cI was trying to explain things like Facebook and social media to him, but he still can\u2019t really believe it,\u201d Ryan Lasko said. \u201cThis worldwide scope is something he\u2019s still trying to wrap his head around.\u201d", "lede": "Hal Lasko may be 98 years old, but while many of his peers devote...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/pixel-painter-ms-paint/"}]}, {"cluster": 10, "articles": [{"author": "Jason Inofuentes", "title": "Intel powers an Arduino for the first time with new \u201cGalileo\u201d board", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 15:02:22", "content": "Intel At IDF last month, Intel previewed its latest small chip initiative, Quark. Slotting in well below the Atom line, much less Haswell, Quark is aimed at that old chestnut, \"the Internet of things.\" We were curious about when we'd see the first consumer Quark device, and it seems the time is now. At Maker Faire Rome today, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich introduced a collaboration between open source bastion Arduino and Intel's New Devices Group, and the first fruits of that collaboration are Galileo \u00a0(PDF). Typically driven by simple microcontrollers, basic Arduino boards are usually quite limited in connectivity, mainly USB and some Arduino-specific connectors. Expansion comes through those connectors, which allow daughterboards, called shields, to be layered atop the main board, adding additional I/O options. The ease of use\u2014and ease of expansion\u2014has long made the Arduino a favorite among the do-it-yourself crowd for things as simple as Christmas tree lights or as complex as a homebrewing robot. The Intel Galileo reference board isn't a basic board. The Quark SoC is quite potent for a device of this type, resembling a Pentium 3 more than a microcontroller. Though the legacy Arduino connectors remain for compatibility with shields, Galileo features connectivity through USB (host and client), 100Mbps Ethernet, microSD, RS-232, and a full-size mini-PCI Express slot. \"Intel Galileo features the Intel Quark SoC X1000, the first product from the Intel Quark technology family of low-power, small-core products,\" the company said. \"Intel Quark technology will extend Intel architecture into rapidly growing areas\u2014from the Internet of Things to wearable computing in the future.\" Intel will be donating 50,000 Galileo boards to universities around the world as part of the collaboration, and it will be available to hobbyists for $60 or less by November 29. That price makes Galileo quite competitive with existing Arduino boards, most of which aren't as feature complete. Intel promises full compatibility with Arduino software and existing hardware, which could make this a very attractive board for complex projects. Today's announcement continues Intel's attempts to target the DIY market dominated by Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, and Arduino. Intel recently teamed up with the maker of the BeagleBoard to create the \" Minnowboard ,\" a $199 computer powered by open hardware and software. Tiny computers have been run in large part by Intel's rival ARM lately. That's true of the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone Black . While Arduino traditionally used microcontrollers such as Atmel's, Arduino unveiled its first ARM-powered board one year ago with the Arduino DUE. Intel has boasted that its chips will provide more power, and, of course, compatibility with x86 applications.

A message in an enormous font ( Roboto ) appears on my screen: \u201cTIME ONLY MOVES WHEN YOU MOVE.\u201d Shortly after this I\u2019m given a gun, and discover with glee that I can walk slowly through storms of red bullets, standing still to freeze time when I need a moment to think. I can line up carefully placed shots at the strange, red-colored humanoid enemies that populate SUPERHOT \u2018s five short levels. The game, available for free in browsers , is only a demo. A fully featured product is coming, SUPERHOT creative director Piotr Iwanicki tells WIRED \u2014 eventually. Since Iwanicki, from a city in Poland called \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (pronounced \u201cwoodge\u201d), put out the demo in mid-September, SUPERHOT has been slowly building an army of fans who are hungry for more than the small taste they\u2019ve been given. When Iwanicki put the game on Steam\u2019s Greenlight service, it got enough support to earn a slot on Steam in only five days \u2014 faster than any other game in Greenlight\u2019s short history. There\u2019s obvious promise shown in the free-to-play demo. One level has you running unarmed down a hallway while a small firing squad at the other end showers you with bullets. When you see them shoot, you can stop, figure out the trajectory of the bullets, and dive out of the way. It feels way too cool. Later, in a courtyard shootout, you\u2019ll discover how to pop around corners and set up frozen-in-time bullets aimed at multiple enemies. Then you\u2019ll duck behind a column, the very act of ducking sending the bullets on their way to their targets. Even if you take a full minute to decide a course of action and line up your shots, the events that unfold once you move will only occupy a moment in the flow of actual time. The end of the demo has a bizarre, government conspiracy feel to it, with a disembodied face forcing players to jump to their death out a window. Iwanicki, who used his own face for the scene, says he intentionally made the ending zany, because he\u2019s trying to drive interest for the eventual full version of the game. \u201cWe wanted to leave you feeling that you want more,\u201d he says.

Flutter is a simple Windows and Mac OSX app that lets you control popular media players through a webcam. Just put your hand up to stop the media playback, or point your thumb right for \"next\" and left for \"previous.\" It seems that few people had heard of Flutter (yours truly included) until Google took the company under its wing, but luckily the app is still available for download, so we snagged it and gave it a quick test. The app works fantastically well, and hand gesture detection is near-instant. It works with iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, VLC, Keynote, Winamp, Windows Media Player, and, with a Chrome extension,\u00a0Youtube, Netflix, Pandora, and Grooveshark. Considering the length of that compatibility list, we suspect it's converting your hand signals into the standard media controls that adorn many keyboards. The homepage of the Flutter website has been replaced with the buyout message, but the original page is still up at\u00a0 https://flutterapp.com/home/ . Navneet Dalal, Flutter's CEO, wrote to the company's users today: When we started three years ago, our dream to build a ubiquitous and power-efficient gesture recognition technology was considered by many as just \"a dream,\" not a real possibility. Since then, we have strived to build the best machine vision algorithms and a delightful user experience. Even after we launched our first app, we didn\u2019t stop our research; your enthusiasm and support pushed us to continue to do better. We're inspired every day when we hear, for example, that Flutter makes you feel like a superhero\u2014because any sufficiently advanced technology should be indistinguishable from magic, right? Today, we are thrilled to announce that we will be continuing our research at Google. We share Google\u2019s passion for 10x thinking, and we\u2019re excited to add their rocket fuel to our journey. We\u2019d like to extend a special thank you to all of our users; your feedback and evangelism inspire us every day. Flutter users will be able to continue to use the app, and stay tuned for future updates. The next question is, what will Google do with a webcam gesture app? The most obvious choice is that it will integrate the functionality into Chromebooks\u00a0or Chrome itself. Flutter's hand gesture recognition could be a big differentiator and would keep the company a step ahead of the OEMs that are working to integrate Leap Motion's more\u00a0 frustrating hand gesture \u00a0technology. With zero extra hardware required, it's much cheaper than Leap technology, too. Using Flutter's capabilities in Android could be another path for Google. Currently, Samsung has a similar feature in its smartphones called \"Air Gesture,\" which lets you accept calls, switch music tracks, flip through pictures, and turn the screen on, all through gestures performed in front of the front-facing camera. If you're interested, you can try the latest edition to the Google Hivemind for yourself.

Flies were buzzing around the bloodied patch of earth outside a ransacked mosque in Tha Phyu Chai village where police removed Khin Naing's body after he was hacked to death by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists. \"He couldn't run fast enough from the Rakhine people,\" said his son, Tun Tun Naing, 17, who emerged from hiding to identify his father's corpse from what remained of his charred clothing. Khin Naing was one of five Muslims killed and four Rakhine Buddhists wounded in four days of violence in Thandwe, a township in western Rakhine State popular with foreign tourists for its nearby Ngapali Beach. Not far from its resorts, Buddhists armed with sticks, slingshots and machetes launched repeated attacks on Muslim villagers from Sunday, burning down dozens of homes, witnesses said. Sectarian violence in Myanmar has killed at least 240 people and displaced 140,000, most of them Muslims, since June 2012. The latest bloodshed in Thandwe shows Myanmar's reformist government struggling to curb the spread of a Buddhist nationalist movement known as 969 and control members of an ethnic Rakhine political party implicated in violence. The 969 movement is led by firebrand monks who preach that Islam is a threat and urge supporters to shun interfaith marriage and boycott Muslim-run businesses. The numbers symbolise the Buddha, his teachings and the monkhood. Many anti-Muslim attacks have taken place where monks have preached the 969 creed but the violence had ebbed in recent weeks until the Thandwe attacks. Police in Thandwe say they have arrested six people, including the local chairman of the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party (RNDP) and supporters of the 969 movement. RNDP members were implicated in anti-Muslim violence last October in which at least 89 people were killed, a Reuters investigation found. The latest violence coincided with a three-day visit to Rakhine State by President Thein Sein. Tension was high as he arrived in Thandwe on Wednesday, with police firing shots in the air to disperse a crowd. \"ENEMY BASES\" Evidence of 969 activity is hard to miss. Banners bearing the movement's logo flank roads to Ngapali beach. Muslims said 969 supporters had recently blasted Buddhist nationalistic songs from speakers at Thandwe town hall. That followed a sermon in Shwe Hlay village by a prominent 969 monk called Wirathu, who once described mosques as \"enemy bases\". \"After that, we had to be very careful in the village and not bump into Buddhists or make them angry,\" said Myint Aung, one of scores of Muslim residents of Tha Phyu Chai village huddled near one of the few homes left standing. Wirathu's admirers include Sann Sint, minister of religious affairs, who told Reuters in June the monk only promoted \"love and understanding between religions\". President Thein Sein has called Wirathu \"a son of Lord Buddha\" and said 969 \"is just a symbol of peace\". About five percent of Myanmar's 60 million people are Muslim, according to government estimates. About a million more are Rohingya Muslims, mostly stateless and living in northern Rakhine State. Maung Myint Htay, a Buddhist resident of Tha Phyu Chai, said he played no part in Tuesday's attacks, but didn't condemn them. \"It's not wrong,\" he said, adding that Rakhine people had a \"historical duty\" to protect their homeland from Muslims. Myint Moe of a group called the Committee for the Protection of Religion and Nationality acknowledged that he distributed 969 stickers and had the support of hundreds of Buddhist monks. Myint Moe rejected the name \"Rohingya\" and instead referred to members of that community as \"Bengalis\", a term that implies they are illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. An RNDP official in Thandwe said the arrest of party members could cause more unrest. \"It's the responsibility of the government because they arrested the party leader and religious leaders,\" said Maung Maung Phyu. \"People are angry.\" (Amends transliteration of name in paragraph three to Tun.)

Adobe dropped the bombshell revelation shortly after KrebsonSecurity's Brian Krebs reported that the hack began sometime in mid August and was carried out by the same criminals who breached LexisNexis and other major US data brokers. In the course of investigating the earlier intrusions, Krebs said he happened upon a 40 gigabyte trove of source code, much of it belonging to Adobe. Adobe confirmed its ColdFusion Web application software and its Acrobat document program were among those that were stolen. A new generation of exploits The Acrobat software family, which is intimately linked to the nearly ubiquitous Reader application, has long been a favorite target of malware developers looking for ways to sneak their malicious wares onto people's computers. The specter of hackers having full access to the raw source code of those applications is troubling, because it could make it easier to identify bugs that can be surreptitiously exploited in drive-by website attacks. \"This breach poses a serious concern to countless businesses and individuals,\" a statement issued by Holder Security , which assisted in Krebs's investigation, warned. \"While we are not aware of specific use of data from the source code, we fear that disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data. Effectively, this breach may have opened a gateway for a new generation of viruses, malware, and exploits.\" Adobe Chief Security Officer Brad Arkin said officials aren't aware of any unpatched vulnerabilities being targeted in any of the company's products. \"However, as always, we recommend customers run only supported versions of the software, apply all available security updates, and follow the advice of the Acrobat Enterprise Toolkit and the ColdFusion Lockdown Guide ,\" he added. He thanked Krebs and Alex Holden of Hold Security for their help in responding to the intrusion. Krebs said Adobe engineers are still in the process of checking on the integrity of its source code. The investigation includes looking for \"anomalous check-in activity on its code repositories,\" which could indicate the intruders were able to introduce backdoors or security bugs or otherwise tamper with the underlying applications. \"We are looking at malware analysis and exploring the different digital assets we have,\" Arkin told Krebs. \"Right now the investigation is really into the trail of breadcrumbs of where the bad guys touched.\" In an advisory , Arkin said attackers removed information for 2.9 million customers from company computers. That data included customer names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and other information relating to orders. Attackers also accessed customer IDs and \"encrypted\" (by which Adobe probably means cryptographically hashed) passwords. Customer passwords will be reset, and Arkin recommended customers change passwords on other sites if they matched those used in their Adobe accounts.

Krebs said that one of the related intrusions he uncovered\u2014into the network of the National White Collar Crime Center\u2014appears to have been initiated by exploiting weaknesses in Adobe's ColdFusion product.

But for now, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda saw no need to ease policy further as Japan was on the path to escape deflation and, if international risks receded as hoped, government fiscal stimulus would further boost growth next year. The U.S. budget deadlock and fears of an unprecedented U.S. default dragged Tokyo shares to a four-week low and boosted the yen, casting a cloud on an otherwise upbeat outlook for Japan's export-driven economy. \"If this continues for a long time, this could destabilize financial markets and worsen sentiment,\" Kuroda told reporters after a two-day policy review meeting, adding that the BOJ was ready to respond to any sudden shocks. He declined to comment on the possibility of a U.S. debt default, but said the consequences of a prolonged standoff on global markets would be \"severe.\" \"We sincerely hope a solution is reached at an early date,\" Kuroda said. Through its massive holding of U.S. government debt, Japan is one America's biggest creditors. Other top international policymakers have also warned that a failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling before mid-month would be a serious blow to the world economy. As widely expected, the BOJ kept intact its intense monetary stimulus launched in April, under which it aims to double base money via asset purchases to meet its target of lifting inflation to 2 percent in roughly two years. EYES GDP REVISION UPGRADE On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would proceed with a planned increase in the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent next April, and cushion its impact with a 5 trillion yen ($51 billion) stimulus package. Kuroda said the tax rise was an important first step in reining in Japan's huge public debt which, at double the size of its $5 trillion economy, is the biggest among major industrialized nations. He also said the stimulus package would give a significant boost to growth, suggesting the central bank will revise up its long-term economic forecasts when they are released on October 31. The BOJ upgraded its assessment on capital expenditure to say it was picking up, adding strength to its view the economy was recovering moderately and suggesting that no additional monetary policy measures are needed to counter the impact of the sales tax increase. Japan's economy has now grown for three successive quarters as Abe's reflationary policies bolstered household spending and drove down the yen, benefiting exports, with annualized growth of 3.8 percent in April-June outpacing many G7 nations. The BOJ expects the sales tax hike to shave about 0.7 percentage point off growth, and estimates the economy will expand 1.3 percent in the business year beginning in April 2014. This already far outpaces the 0.7 percent growth projected in a recent Reuters poll, and its forecast does not factor in the effect of the government's stimulus package. \"I don't think the BOJ's view that the sales tax hike won't derail the recovery is too optimistic,\" said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities. \"But the 2 percent inflation remains a distant goal. Core consumer inflation could hit 1 percent early next year. But it's an uphill battle from there.\" Having launched its intense burst of stimulus in April, the BOJ does not want to act again easily. But it has not ruled out expanding stimulus if the damage from the tax hike proves bigger than expected and threatens the 2 percent inflation target. The big test will come in spring next year, and not just from the sales tax. By then there will also be more clarity on whether companies will raise wages enough to offset some of the pain households will feel from the tax hike, BOJ officials say.

Another thing they\u2019re doing is using natural language processing to match symptoms patients are reporting with appropriate doctors.

Oscar is actually licensed as a health insurance operator in the state of New York, so it isn\u2019t some kind of front-end. This also gives it more power to be creative with the entire consumer experience. And the $40 million the company raised isn\u2019t actually all going toward operations.

A set of redefining technological trends is reshaping the landscape from a slow and cumbersome process practiced mainly by large enterprises to a much more flexible, agile process that mid-market companies as well as individuals can utilize. This report explores the key features that influence the evolution of agile BI and takes a look at the BI landscape under this light. At first glance, polarization seems to exist between traditional BI vendors, who are focused on extract, transform, and load (ETL) and reporting, and the newcomers, who are focused on data exploration and visualization, but a closer look reveals that, in fact, they converge as adoption of useful features is taking place across the spectrum. This report will illustrate for both the traditional BI vendors and the newcomers that: As the market is expanding, features such as cloud support and embedded domain-specific knowledge in BI solutions are key. Initially, the benefits will be more obvious to those smaller players who do not have the resources for in-house infrastructure and extended internal projects and who are driven more by needing immediate results. Over the long run, however, these features can benefit all types of organizations. Ubiquity and mobility are key features of data today; therefore, the ability to support a multitude of data sources with as little effort as possible \u2013 integrating them and accessing analysis results via a multitude of channels \u2013 is important in order to keep up.

It's also geared toward first-time smartphone owners with its simple interface and an $80 unlocked price. This combination of open, standards-based software and affordable hardware sounds like a dream for both developers and newcomers alike. But is that how it works in practice? Read our review and you'll find out. &#13; ZTE Open review &#13; See all photos &#13; 25 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; Hardware The design of the Open is an exercise in minimalism. A close cousin of the Android-based Kis III , it feels like a large, smooth pebble -- albeit one covered in soft-touch plastic. It's very comfortable to hold as a result, although the thin back cover and smudge-prone 3.5-inch screen will remind you that you're using a low-end handset. ZTE does deserve some kudos for embracing Firefox's native colors -- whether you buy an Open in blue or orange, your phone is destined to stand out. The back-to-basics philosophy extends to the controls and ports. Aside from the screen, the only features on the front are an LED (for charging only) and a capacitive home button. There's no front-facing camera, unfortunately. On the left is a volume rocker that's easy to use by feel alone; the top holds both a power button and a headphone jack, while the micro-USB port and microphone sit at the bottom. You'll find only a 2-megapixel camera and speaker on the back, although it's easy to pop off the rear cover and get access to both the 1,200mAh battery as well as the SIM and microSDHC card slots. That accessibility is essential, too, as the built-in 512MB of storage isn't enough to hold a media collection. The eBay version (available in the US and UK) doesn't ship with any microSD expansion, although carriers like Movistar Spain include a 4GB card in the box. As you've likely gathered, the Open will disappoint if you're looking for clever hardware tricks. There are no shortcut keys, notification lights or water resistance . About all you'll get for luxury is an FM radio. However, there's a refreshing simplicity to the design. It's tailor-made for newcomers to the smartphone world who don't need (or don't care for) any frills. While we wish that the components inside were more powerful, the form factor is at least appealing. ZTE Open Dimensions 114 x 62 x 12.5 mm (4.5 x 2.4 x 0.5 inches) Weight 120g (4.2 oz) Screen size 3.5 inches Screen resolution 480 x 320 Screen type TFT LCD Battery 1,200mAh lithium-ion (removable) Internal storage 512MB External storage MicroSDHC, up to 32GB Rear camera 2MP (fixed-focus) Front-facing cam None Video capture 352 x 288 NFC No Radios GSM GPRS / EDGE (850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900); HSDPA (850 / 1900) Bluetooth v2.1 SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM7225A CPU 1GHz single-core ARM Cortex-A5 GPU Adreno 200 RAM 256MB Entertainment None (USB mass storage for transfers) WiFi Dual-band, 802.11a/b/g/n Wireless Charging No Operating system Firefox OS 1.1 (1.0.1 on current units) Display Many smartphones under $100 have very basic displays, and that's exactly what you'll get with the Open. At 3.5 inches, the LCD is a bit too small for fast typing with Mozilla's on-screen keyboard. The 480 x 320 resolution is usable, but not exactly sharp. Colors are adequate (if flat) head-on, but they wash out when you view the phone from a sharp angle. The screen is at least readable in sunlight, though. To us, responsiveness is the display's main flaw. Despite using capacitive input, the Open's touchscreen just isn't very sensitive or accurate. It was too easy for us to miss a photo opportunity because our shutter press didn't register, or to launch an app when we meant to scroll. Even swiping down the notification bar requires a bit more effort than we're used to. The unresponsiveness is occasionally frustrating, and we'd expect better even at this modest price point. It wouldn't take much to get a significantly improved display, either. Contrast the Open with a more expensive (if still frugal) phone like the LG Optimus L3 II : LG may have shed some screen resolution, but its display is both more responsive and produces richer colors. While ZTE doesn't have to compete in the Optimus L3 II's price bracket, it should have spent more on the screen. Camera We'll be blunt: the Open's 2-megapixel rear camera is terrible, even by the standards of entry-level phone photography. Virtually every photo is full of blocky compression artifacts, noise and color inaccuracies. Well-lit photos in any environment are defined by purple fringing effects and blown-out highlights, while low-light images lose most of the visible detail. There's no flash to fill in that detail, and the fixed focus rules out any macro shots. We'd still take the Open's camera over none at all, but that's not exactly a compliment. &#13; ZTE Open sample shots &#13; See all photos &#13; 26 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; This isn't helped by the camera software, which is as rudimentary as it gets. Your options are to shoot photos, shoot videos or visit the gallery app -- and that's it. There are no settings or special modes. While there's a healthy selection of editing and sharing options in the gallery, such as cropping and exposure compensation, you'll have little input when taking the snapshot. Thankfully, Mozilla's Principal Developer Evangelist Christian Heilmann tells us that the basic feature set is due more to the hardware than the OS. We'd expect more advanced phones to get improved controls. Just be warned that video recording is equally crude, if not more so. You can only shoot 352 x 188, 20 fps movies with single-channel sound. The image quality is decent for the resolution, but the audio is worse than a phone call. We'd use the Open's video mode only as a last resort. Software This is why you're reading, really. The Open is the first taste of Firefox OS for many people, including programmers who want to test their Firefox OS apps on a real device. As such, a quick explanation of the platform is in order. At its heart, Firefox OS is a Linux variant that runs HTML5-based web apps instead of native code, even for hardware-dependent features like phone calls. Mozilla believes that its web focus liberates mobile app development ; by using open standards like HTML5, developers won't be locked into supporting just one device ecosystem. It could also make smartphones more affordable, as devices won't need to store apps that primarily run online. As Heilmann explains, it's meant to deliver a smartphone experience to those who'd otherwise buy a basic cellphone -- not to become the \"next iOS or Android.\" It may be a while before we get Firefox OS software that feels completely at home in the modern smartphone world. The basic experience will be familiar to anyone who has used iOS or Android, since it borrows a few concepts from both. Users get a basic home screen with a search box, a tray of customizable app shortcuts and an expandable notification bar with quick settings. Swiping to the right scrolls through your apps. Like iOS, almost every navigation element is onscreen; while that consumes extra space, it's potentially simpler for users who haven't tried (or just don't want) hardware keys. Ultimately, the interface is easy enough to understand that it takes just a few minutes to learn the ins and outs of the platform. That's no doubt the point. Mozilla wants even first-time smartphone owners to feel at home, and we'd say that the company succeeded. That simplicity extends to the search box, which epitomizes the web-based strategy of Firefox OS. Officially known as the adaptive app search field, the box shows web results as though they were apps, not pages. Look for sushi and you'll get icons for the likes of Epicurious (for sushi recipes) or Google Maps (to find nearby sushi places). Any relevant local apps appear in the list, and you can \"install\" any result as an app. The approach is simple and largely works, although it may be slightly confusing to users who won't always see an explanation of where a web link will go. Thankfully, they can always use the Firefox browser to see traditional, text-based web results. &#13; ZTE Open software photos &#13; See all photos &#13; 16 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; We have mixed reactions to this emphasis on web apps. The philosophy lets developers quickly port apps to Firefox OS, and lets phone makers include a lot of apps that aren't always available beyond major platforms. Our test unit shipped with third-party apps like AccuWeather, Facebook, Nokia's Here Maps , Twitter, Wikipedia and YouTube. However, this can be frustrating when you realize that most existing Firefox OS apps aren't much more capable than a mobile-optimized website. Here Maps can cache an area you're looking at for offline use, as it can elsewhere, but you can't jump over to Here Drive (like on Windows Phone) to get turn-by-turn navigation. Accordingly, you tend to lose major functionality present in native apps on other platforms, like most forms of push notifications and inter-app communication. Mozilla tells us that cross-app support is rolling out, and that app notifications will come in the OS' 1.2 upgrade; still, it may be a while before we get Firefox OS software that feels completely at home in the modern smartphone world. It's difficult to realize exactly what you're missing, as there aren't many apps in the Firefox Marketplace, Mozilla's official store. While that's somewhat forgivable given the web push and Firefox OS' limited market presence, it also leaves us hard-pressed to find the big-name apps that we like. Right now, many Firefox OS programs are filling holes left by better-known titles: Check-In Fox replaces Foursquare, for example, while Sketchbook Squad substitutes for Doodle Jump . We have noticed major releases like Pulse and SoundCloud , but they're in the minority. Discovery is limited to finding the newest or most popular apps in a given category. Although Firefox Marketplace will undoubtedly grow in the months ahead, it currently doesn't hold a candle to mature app portals like the App Store, Google Play or the Windows Phone Store. The OS itself is equally young. The Open unit we received is running a pre-release version of Firefox OS 1.1, which introduces surprisingly basic features like MMS and a search option in the music app. The phones on the market as of this writing are still using 1.0.1, and there's no word on whether or not they'll get 1.1 or later. Mozilla says that it can push security fixes itself -- an important advantage over some platforms -- but that bigger updates will usually require carrier or manufacturer approval. Regardless of the OS version, many of the stock apps include only the bare essentials. You can't put a video on repeat, for instance, and media syncing is limited to copying files in USB mass storage mode. Concepts like NFC and voice recognition just don't exist in Firefox OS at this stage, and there's no guarantee that they will, given the focus on low-cost, open technology. Firefox OS may be a great introduction to smartphones, but it's limiting for seasoned users. Performance and battery life Gauging the Open's performance is far trickier than it is with other devices. It's not just that we're looking at our first Firefox OS device, which prevents many direct comparisons; it's also that there are very few benchmarking tools. Still, there's enough here to give a clear indication of how well ZTE's handset deals with common tasks. Mozilla needs more capable hardware to demonstrate Firefox OS' potential. Getting around the OS is smooth enough. Although the Open is running on just a 1GHz, single-core Snapdragon MSM7225A and 256MB of RAM, the home screen, browser and many apps are mostly stutter-free. The hardware could keep up with a few 2D action games, too. Just don't expect a media powerhouse. We couldn't play H.264-encoded 720p video, and there aren't yet 3D games available (though WebGL makes these possible). More importantly, browsing -- Firefox OS' very reason for being -- falls a bit short. Everyday web surfing is fine, but more sophisticated pages and web apps either take a while to load or periodically bog down. That subjective experience is supported by our web benchmarking. The Open took 3,665ms to complete the SunSpider JavaScript test, or more than twice as long as the Lumia 520 (1,400ms). It's more comparable to the 2009-era Motorola Milestone , better known as the GSM equivalent to the Droid ; it wasn't much slower at 4,628ms. We tried other web tests to play it safe, and the results were less than flattering. Kraken, Mozilla's own JavaScript benchmark, took 67,371ms to complete where a Moto X we have on hand (admittedly, well beyond the Open's league) can finish that same test in 9,295ms. Google's Octane wouldn't even run on the Open -- it took several tries just to reach the page without an error, and the phone would invariably give up partway through. Cellular data is also an issue. We're not concerned about the Open's modest HSPA speeds, which on Canada's Telus network averaged about 3.1 Mbps for downloads and 1.3 Mbps for uploads. It's the reception that sours the experience. The Open is very sensitive to signal changes, and it's considerably more likely to drop its data link (at least in Ottawa) where other devices using the same 3G service work properly. When a phone that absolutely needs a good internet connection has trouble sustaining that connection, there's a serious problem. Battery life, on the other hand, is superb. Whatever gripes we might have with the basic software feature set, it keeps the Open running for a long time on a small lithium-ion pack. We couldn't run our usual looping video test, but it was easy to last through a day of moderate-to-heavy use that included several checks of both Facebook and Twitter, a similar amount of browsing, a 20-minute call, 20 photos and two short videos. Based on less-strenuous use after our formal testing, we could see the Open lasting for two or even three days without a fresh charge. Call quality is also good. In reasonably quiet situations, both ends of the call are loud and generally quite clear. There's no noise-canceling microphone, though, so you'll have to shout if you're in a loud environment. The rear speaker puts out sound at moderate volumes, and it isn't anything to write home about. Wrap-up We should reiterate what we said earlier in the review: the ZTE Open is partly intended as a developer phone. For those customers, it does the job well. You don't need a quad-core processor or a 1080p display to demonstrate that your HTML5 app runs properly. For $80 unlocked, the smartphone is even something of a bargain; it's cheap enough that you could buy several for a programming team. If you're looking for a testbed device, don't hesitate to pick one up. There are also certain everyday customers who might like the Open. If you're just considering a smartphone for the first time and object to the complexity or cost of what's on the market, it's hard to beat the pricing. On Movistar Spain, the Open costs \u20ac58 ($78) with prepaid service; the Optimus L3 II is twice as expensive, at \u20ac116 ($156). Travel to Colombia and the 149,900 pesos (also $78) that you'll pay at Movistar will easily undercut a phone like Samsung's Galaxy Young , which costs 317,900 pesos ($167). Mozilla argues that Firefox OS brings smartphones to a wider audience, and it's right -- some customers would be relegated to a basic feature phone if the Open weren't available. For many of you reading this, the Open won't make sense. The price differences between the Open and more advanced devices either won't matter as much, or aren't that large to start with. Americans will want to look at the Nokia Lumia 620 from Aio Wireless -- it's only slightly more expensive at $100 prepaid, but much more powerful. If you can spend $30 more beyond that, you may also want to consider a few Samsung phones, such as the Galaxy Amp (at Aio Wireless) and Galaxy Reverb (at Virgin Mobile). It's a tougher call if you're in Spain or another market where these deals aren't available, but we would investigate phones like the Optimus L3 II or Sony Xperia E . The Open is fine as a child's first phone or a backup device, however. Whether or not the Open fits your needs, one thing is clear: Mozilla needs more capable hardware to demonstrate Firefox OS' potential. The Open is good for someone whose alternative would be a basic flip phone, but the camera quality, connectivity, display and performance don't do full justice to the software. Thankfully, more smartphones are coming. Along with a more powerful ZTE phone , we can also expect the (unsanctioned) Geeksphone Peak+ . The as-yet-unannounced devices from Huawei and LG may also be worth waiting for. Firefox OS could easily take off -- it just needs a better launch vehicle. &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;", "lede": "&#13; As the first Firefox OS smartphone, the ZTE Open is an amba...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/zte-open-review/"}, {"author": "Richard Lawler", "title": "Google Glassware Review Process opens, gives devs a path to MyGlass listing", "feed_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:14:00", "content": "&#13; Developers eagerly working on services for the Google Glass headset finally have a clear avenue for release, now that the Glassware Review Process is ready.

Completing the Glassware review process will make your Glassware eligible to show on MyGlass and eligible to receive quota beyond the testing limit. \u201c I\u2019ve been testing Google Glass of late and it\u2019s actually interesting how apps are installed. A main application called MyGlass is used to manage the Glass device: With it you can view what the Glass camera sees or set up connectivity.\u00a0Aside from device management, MyGlass acts like a mini app store for Glass. I just checked and the five new apps are already there; by selecting one or more, data from those apps will start appearing in Glass. So far, I find Glass very interesting from a wearable device perspective, but also limiting: It\u2019s great for specific Google services and a few others, however, the real potential will likely come from third-party apps.

This mobile app, called Circa News , doesn\u2019t give you articles. It gives you an endless stream of new information \u2014 the most important facts of the day, delivered as quickly as they arrive on the web. \u201cWe call it atomization,\u201d Galligan says. \u201cWe take a story, break it down into its core elements, and then tell that story over time.\u201d It\u2019s an intriguing crusade that seeks to reduce the time needed to digest the daily news \u2014 you can take in each new fact in between everything else you\u2019re doing on your phone, from checking email to posting pics on Facebook \u2014 and it only gets more interesting when Galligan mentions the rather unexpected place where he and his company drew their inspiration. They\u2019re reinventing news in the image of open source software code. Circa is yet another way that the very geeky world of programming is the way we do so many other things, from renovating houses to penning wedding invitations to writing laws . As it turns out, the way we build software code is also a great way to build just about anything. Galligan calls himself a serial entrepreneur, but he\u2019s also someone who has tried his hand at building software \u2014 at least on a small scale. More than a year ago, he teamed up with Ben Huh \u2014 the man whose Cheezburger blogging network reinvented online cat videos \u2014 to create a company that would overhaul the idea of online news. But the Circa app didn\u2019t really take shape until Galligan and a few tech-types got together and someone mentioned \u201cversion control.\u201d That\u2019s geek-speak for systems like GitHub , the widely popular online service that lets people collaborate on software projects. Anyone can add new code to a project through something called a \u201cpull request.\u201d They can instantly create a new project by \u201cforking\u201d an existing piece of code. And they can just as easily merge pieces of code together. What the Circa team realized is that they could treat news in much the same way. They could separate it into tiny pieces and use these pieces to build stories as time goes on. \u201cRather than write an article,\u201d says Galligan, \u201cwe decided to write stories as code gets written.\u201d Galligan employs a team of writers who distill a breaking story into a handful of key facts, and then, as the story develops, they can add new facts \u2014 or they can separate a key fact and use it as the basis for a new storyline. If the original story is the bombing of the Boston Marathon, for instance, it might branch into a separate story about the manhunt for the suspected bombers. \u201cNews works in this way,\u201d Galigan says. \u201cYou might work down one storyline for a while, but then it might fork .\u201d The metaphor then extends to everyone who uses the Circa mobile app. With the app, you can \u201cfollow\u201d stories in much the same way you follow someone posting to Twitter or, yes, follow software projects hosted on GitHub. If a story forks, you can then follow the fork too. Rather than reading articles, you\u2019re reading streams of news. \u201cI compare it to the Presidential Daily Brief,\u201d says Lane Wood, a longtime Circa user. \u201cYou get all the important information, and you get it really quickly and concisely \u2014 in a way that you can just easily consume it from your phone. You\u2019re in and you\u2019re out, and you\u2019re informed.\u201d Lane is currently following a story on the government shutdown. \u201cI could sift through Google News for a lot of long articles,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really, all I want to know is: Was there any progress made? What happened? Who said what? Those small, snippet updates are delivered to me, and I know exactly what\u2019s new.\u201d The app has been available for iPhone for more than a year, and today, Galligan and company released a version for Android phones as well. It now includes what Galligan calls \u201cnews alerts,\u201d which means the app will actively notify you when an important story has broken. With the click of an icon, you can then instantly follow that story as you would any other. Some may scoff at the idea of atomizing news in this way. But it\u2019s the way the world is moving. \u201cNews used to compete with news,\u201d says Galligan. \u201cBut now it competes with Angry Birds and Snapchat.\u201d For so many of us, Twitter itself has become a de facto news feed. We treat our world like an endless stream of tiny things \u2014 be they ideas or tasks or little bits of fun \u2014 and then, through machines, we collect and shape these things into something larger. We treat our world like software code.", "lede": "Matt Galligan is reinventing the way news works, ripping apart th...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/10/78301/"}]}, {"cluster": 16, "articles": [{"author": "Joe Mullin", "title": "Patent goliath Intellectual Ventures looks to raise another $3 billion", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 01:41:57", "content": "Patent-holding giant Intellectual Ventures (IV) has been making the rounds seeking investors for a new patent-purchasing fund, according to a Reuters report . The company is apparently out of money, having spent the $6 billion it has raised since its inception in 2000. For the time being, it has stopped buying new patents. According to the material IV gave to prospective investors, which were reviewed by Reuters, the company has achieved average return of 16.2 percent on the first patent fund it put together, in 2003. Its second fund, completed in 2008, has achieved an average of return of 2.5 percent. Those numbers seem somewhat questionable, though, in light of one of the few publicly available sources of IV returns. The\u00a0University of Texas Investment Management Company, or UTIMCO, was an early investor in IV and is required by law to disclose its annual returns. UTIMCO invested $50 million in IV's 2008 fund, but the value of its stake has decreased by about four percent, making it the fifth-worst investment that investment group made in 2008. UTIMCO's investment in one IV fund, the Invention Development Fund, has been a disastrous 70 percent loss. Several of the companies that once teamed up with IV on its first round of investment can surely be counted on not to join up this time. Google and Xilinx, for instance, both joined up with IV a decade ago when it had positioned itself as a kind of \"patent defense fund.\" After accepting their cash, IV has actually sued both Xilinx and Google (through its Motorola division) for patent infringement. Microsoft, an early IV backer which continues to have some ties to the patent-holding firm, told Reuters it has not invested in the new fund \"at this time.\" Intellectual Ventures was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft CTO. Intellectual Ventures refused to discuss the new fund-raising activity. For many years IV eschewed lawsuits, but it began filing them in 2010.

Obama had planned to depart on Saturday for a four-nation, week-long trip. He canceled visits to Malaysia and the Philippines earlier this week because of his budget struggle in the U.S. Congress and said late on Thursday he would not attend the regional summits in Indonesia and Brunei. The political standoff over the U.S. budget has shut down non-essential government services and appeared likely to drag on for another week or longer. Another crisis looms in two weeks when lawmakers must decide whether to increase the U.S. government's $16.7 trillion debt borrowing limit. \"The president made this decision based on the difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown, and his determination to continue pressing his case that Republicans should immediately allow a vote to reopen the government,\" the White House said. Obama was scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, among other leaders, at the summits. Two of his main aims would have been to discuss the Syria crisis with Putin and to hold talks on a maritime code of conduct for disputed territories in the oil- and gas-rich South China Sea. \"We are disappointed,\" said Indonesian Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring on the island of Bali, host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from Sunday. \"I think the summit will go on, there is a long-term plan. (But) without Obama, you can imagine how disappointed we are. We could hardly imagine he wouldn't come.\" Obama was also scheduled to attend the East Asia Summit, organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in Brunei next week. Xi, who was on a visit to Malaysia on Friday, did not comment on Obama's decision. But analysts said the no-show by the U.S. president would work to China's advantage. \"While his decision is perfectly understandable, it projects a poor image of America as a country that is politically dysfunctional and on the verge of another economic crisis,\" said Ian Storey, senior fellow at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. \"Meanwhile, cash-rich and self-confident China will have the floor to itself.\" Obama twice postponed visits to Indonesia and Australia in 2010, because of a health reform bill and then because of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. He was absent from the APEC meeting last year in Vladivostok, Russia because of a Democratic Party convention. SEVERE DILEMMA In Tokyo, Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said Abe would attend the summits as planned. \"This is a domestic problem of the United States,\" he said. \"We hope the (Obama) administration and Congress negotiate earnestly to solve the problem as early as possible, so that the problem won't be affecting various issues.\" Storey said the latest domestic crisis was posing a severe dilemma for Obama, since it clashed with a cherished foreign policy objective. At the APEC and East Asia Summits two years ago, Obama announced the U.S. strategic pivot, or rebalancing, toward Asia, which was seen as a reaction to the growing clout of China. \"On the one hand he needs to be in Asia to demonstrate America's commitment to the region and especially to the ASEAN-led regional security architecture that has been one of the central planks of his administration's Asia policy,\" said Storey. \"But with government employees on unpaid leave, Obama cannot afford to leave Washington and be seen hob-nobbing with world leaders on a tropical island.\" The Washington stalemate has idled hundreds of thousands of federal government workers and comes two weeks before Washington faces an even more crucial deadline - raising the U.S. debt limit so the United States can pay its bills. A bitter debate rages over that issue as well and if left unresolved could result in a U.S. debt default. Denis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific region, said not too much should be read into Obama's decision to call off the tour. \"I would read nothing more into the postponement of President Obama's trip than that he has to stay on and take care of this (crisis),\" he told reporters in Manila. \"I'm very confident that he will reschedule and frankly it will be a better visit if he's not on the phone having to call back home to get reports on the latest development there.\" Secretary of State John Kerry will lead delegations to both summits in place of Obama. Kerry will also go to Malaysia and the Philippines. Obama phoned both President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the Sultan of Brunei to inform them of his decision, the White House said. Obama looks forward to working with Asian allies and returning to the region at a later date, the White House said.

Because Google Now Eats Siri's Lunch", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:53:05", "content": "Apple has acquired the \u2018smart assistant\u2019 company Cue, for over $40M. Why? Because Google is absolutely murdering Apple when it comes to the utility of Google Now. Apple is likely to use the acquisition, or its talent, to bolster the offerings of its Today section with additional signals curated from email, social networks and more. This would improve the utility of the section, which is fairly sparse right now, and enable Apple to more vigorously compete with Google Now. Google\u2019s service already collates data from all of its services and networks, offering proactive information and assistance to users on Android (and in the iOS Search app). Siri and iOS 7\u2032s new Today section of the Notification Center simply don\u2019t compare to Google Now in-depth, usability or overall power. The ability of Google to tap into the deep array of contextual data that people have living in their Gmail inboxes and other Google products is being leveraged wonderfully by the Google Now team. I\u2019ve said before that Google Now can be considered reason enough to buy an Android phone, and I don\u2019t think Apple is blind to how good it is. With iOS 7, Apple introduced Today as a way to show you upcoming appointments, weather and basic directions to home or to work. This is sort of skimming the top of what is possible with the host of sensors your smartphone has available to it and the troves of data that you store in your inbox and other services. It doesn\u2019t dip into your Mail.app data, or provide information based on your location besides simple \u2018get there\u2019 directions.\u00a0 Google Now does all of that and a lot more, providing transit instructions and recommendations on timing if you\u2019re traveling. The card-based interface of Google Now offers a really compelling experience that only Google is churning through enough data to replicate. Apple ostensibly has similar data available to it, especially for heavy iCloud users, but it doesn\u2019t leverage it. There\u2019s just nothing on iOS that compares to the power of Google Now, including Siri and the Today feature. Much of that lies in Google Now\u2019s predictive nature. It doesn\u2019t just tell you what\u2019s going on now, it anticipates the information you might need and delivers it to you\u00a0 before you need it. The iOS version of the Google Now service is prevented from doing a lot of this because it has no deep access to the system. This is where things get interesting, as the Cue acquisition could be used to make Siri more powerful and aware, notifying you either via push notification or voice of things you may not even know you needed. The early arrival of a flight or train, congestion along your favorite route to work, and more. Push notifications are the future of how we communicate with our smart devices, whether they\u2019re pocketable or wearable. Making sure that any that Siri or Today might send are content rich and relevant is an important problem. The close integration of Siri as a responsive system and \u2018Today\u2019 as a proactive system could be greatly aided by the contextual information that was the core of Cue\u2019s feature set. Cue originally leveraged social accounts to provide an accurate picture of what things you had coming up and what you\u2019re going to do. Later in life it turned its attention primarily to email. The experience of the app itself was never \u2018amazing\u2019, per se, but they definitely their claws deep into email parsing and signaling. And that expertise could help beyond just Siri and Today as well, it could also give other apps like Calendar a contextual steroid shot. Rather than getting context-free dates and names there is potential here for Apple to offer a Calendar app that actually helps you get things done , rather than just remind you\u00a0 when\u00a0 things are due. Apps like Sunrise calendar and Donna are displaying what can be done with smartphone sensors and volunteered user data. That\u2019s just the beginning of what\u2019s possible if you own the bones of the OS. These kinds of acquisitions are exactly the kind that Apple likes to make. Small, talented teams that offer it the ability to either implement a new feature or augment an existing one. The proactive use of data in service of the user will be the defining feature of the next generation of smartphones. It will be interesting to see what the Cue team manages to get done.", "lede": "Apple has acquired the \u2018smart assistant\u2019 company Cue, for over $4...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/why-did-apple-buy-cue-because-google-now-eats-siris-lunch/"}, {"author": "Ina Fried", "title": "Apple Posts Fix for Mountain Lion Update That Caused Webcam Problems", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:51:53", "content": "Apple is releasing a software patch on Thursday designed to fix a problem with the latest Mac OS X update that caused the built-in camera in some recent Mac Book Air laptops to no longer function properly.

This source says that the operating system will reach Golden Master status internally by the end of this week or early next week, and it will be labeled as a build number in the high 13A590s or low 13A600s. This will be a slight increase over the current developer build that is version 13A584.\u00a0Earlier today, Apple seeded OS X Mavericks build 13A598 to members of its AppleSeed program, but it is unclear if that new version will ever reach developers. AppleSeed members believe that this build is a GM candidate, but a source says that Apple is already internally seeding newer builds.\u00a0The source has also corroborated our previous report by indicating that OS X Mavericks is currently scheduled to arrive on the Mac App Store within the last ten days of the month of October. Mavericks was supposed to reach GM status a few weeks ago, but critical bugs have kept pushing back the release, according to claims from sources. Since being announced at WWDC, OS X Mavericks is said to have picked up a few minor unannounced features. Namely, the Messages and FaceTime applications have received the ability to block phone numbers and Apple IDs from sending the Mavericks user messages and/or FaceTime calls. This addition brings parity to iOS 7 and the two operating systems will sync in this manner. While this enhancement is probably not surprising, it has not been present in any Mavericks Developer Preview to date. Mavericks will also bring the launch of iCloud Keychain\u2026 With OS X Mavericks nearing its public debut, and iOS 7 having arrived last month, Apple is said to already have diverted the majority of its OS X and iOS resources to development of the next two Apple operating systems: OS X 10.10 and iOS 8. Views to 9to5Mac from 10.10 began in September OS X 10.10 is internally codenamed Syrah (yes, another wine ), and sources hint that Apple has been toying with a new design across the system that is akin, but not as dramatically different, to the new designs found in iOS 7 and iCloud.com. As for iOS 8, development of that OS is making headway, and it will likely bring feature enhancements to Maps. Yesterday we reported that Apple has begun\u00a0 training its AppleCare support staff on OS X Mavericks. While OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 are not scheduled to be announced until next summer, users can expect a few updates in the near future (in addition to Mavericks): a new version of OS X 10.8.5 launched today , and we expect iOS 7.0.3 and iOS 7.1 to arrive by the end of the year. Apple also has several hardware releases still up its sleeve for this fall including multiple new iPads, Macs, and perhaps a fresh TV-related device .

Twitter says that along with things like monthly active users, ad revenue per timeline view is one of the key metrics it uses to evaluate its business. The company treats timeline views (\u201cthe total number of timelines requested when registered users visit Twitter, refresh a timeline or view search results while logged in on our website, mobile website or desktop or mobile applications\u201d) as a measure of user engagement, and it uses ad revenue per timeline view to track its ability to make money from that engagement. By that measure, Twitter\u2019s ability to monetize is improving. It says advertising revenue per timeline view was $0.80 for the three months ending on June 30 of this year, up 26 percent from the same period in 2012. That number is significantly higher in the United States ($2.17) compared to the rest of the world ($0.30), though the international number is up 111 percent year-over-year. Why invent an entirely new ad metric (and one without a handy acronym)? Well, Twitter has an unusual advertising model, with advertisers paying to promote tweets, trends, and accounts in users\u2019 news feeds, so the standard ad measurement of CPMs (the cost per thousand impressions) may not apply. The fact that \u201cadvertising revenue per timeline view\u201d actually measures revenue for every 1,000 timeline views suggests that this metric may be a proxy of sorts for CPMs. (It\u2019s probably a little dodgy to compare Twitter\u2019s numbers with traditional CPMs, but hey, just for fun \u2014 according to eMarketer, Facebook had an effective CPM of $.071 on mobile and $0.19 on desktop in 2012.) However, Twitter is really selling its ads as a way for companies to engage with consumers, so the filing also notes trends in cost per ad engagement \u2014 basically, it\u2019s been falling steadily, with a sequential decrease of 46 percent in the last quarter, 12 percent the quarter before that, and 19 percent the quarter before that. (A decline in cost means Twitter is getting paid less for each engagement.) The filing attributes these declines to an increase in ad inventory, which has been partially offset by growing demand. Advertising also gets its own section (page 18 if you want to read along) in the filing\u2019s discussion of various risk factors, where Twitter notes that all kinds of things could go wrong with its ad programs \u2014 for example, if Twitter is unable to convince brands to invest in building a presence on the service, or if new programs like its video-based Amplify ads don\u2019t take off, or if the decline in cost per engagement continues. As we wrote earlier , Twitter brought in $253 million in revenue in the first six months of the year. Of that amount, $221 million (87 percent) came from ads, compared to $32 million (13 percent) from data licensing. In comparison, the company made $7 million from advertising in all of 2010 (that\u2019s when it launched its first ad programs) and $21 million from data licensing. Oh, and Twitter says that mobile accounts for 65 percent of its ad revenue .", "lede": "If\u00a0you\u2019re reading Twitter\u2019s S-1 filing to see where the business ...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/twitter-ad-numbers/"}, {"author": "Alex Wilhelm", "title": "Twitter's International Revenue Is Skyrocketing, But The Company Is Worried About Sina Weibo And Line", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:12:47", "content": "Twitter\u2019s international revenue is up massively year over year, with the company earning more in the first half of 2013 from outside the United States than it did in all of 2012. Twitter\u2019s full-year 2012 international revenue totaled $53 million, while its first two quarters of 2013 saw $62.8 million in international incomes. According to its S-1 filing , Twitter has sold its \u201cPromoted Products\u201d services in more than 20 countries. That implies that Twitter is able to monetize its service in more than its home market. Users around the world are therefore valuable to the company, and not merely to its usage statistics. International revenue is a growing percentage of its top line, growing from 17 percent of total incomes in 2012, to 25 percent in the first half of 2013. This is healthy for the firm, underlining that it retain revenue growth potential despite becoming an established company. Twitter, like Facebook, generates much of its revenue from mobile usage of its social product. The company, however, is direct that while mobile is currently a strength for it, rival services that are also strong on mobile could slow its growth in usage and revenue. Here\u2019s Twitter\u2019s S-1 name-checking a number of services that could harm its growth: [I]ncreased competition from local websites, mobile applications and services that provide real-time communications, such as Sina Weibo in China, LINE in Japan and Kakao in South Korea, which have expanded and may continue to expand their geographic footprint; If those services were to expand to as many markets as Twitter, they could lower Twitter\u2019s usage, and therefore its ability to sell advertisements. Twitter plans on selling advertisements in more countries in the future it states, but if Line and its ilk slow its rollout, Twitter could find its revenue growth on hold. Twitter is already a mobile company , and it is quickly becoming an international firm. Given strong smartphone penetration in Asia, this is not surprising. But in the markets where it could see the most potential, Twitter will also face the stiffest winds.

One of the standard parts of the S-1 is a letter from the CEO to shareholders, where they lay out their vision for the company. In Twitter\u2019s filing, however, it\u2019s a letter from \u201c@Twitter\u201d. And whereas the letters from Groupon\u2019s Andrew Mason , Zynga\u2019s Mark Pincus , and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg all clocked in at one or two thousand words, Twitter\u2019s letter is just 135, plus an embedded tweet. That\u2019s probably appropriate for a platform that was initially distinguished by the 140-character limit that it imposed on its users. It may also reflect the fact that Twitter isn\u2019t identified with a single founder or executive the way that, say, Facebook is \u2014 none of its founders currently have a full-time role with the company (though apparently co-founders Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone and Ev Williams visited the office today ). And hey, it\u2019s not like the rest of the filing is lacking in a rundown of the company\u2019s perspective on the risks and opportunities that it faces.

People took that idea and strengthened it by using @names to have public conversations, #hashtags to organize movements, and Retweets to spread news around the world.

The company is looking to raise $1 billion in this initial offering, which is set to mint many millionaires among shareholders and founders like Ev Williams, Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone. Currently, the filing does not list a valuation, and sources are saying that\u2019s because they have yet to determine one. Twitter\u2019s revenues have been revealed for the first time, as well. Revenues for 2012 were $316.9 million, for a loss of $79.4 million and in the first half of 2013 they\u2019ve already earned $253.6 million for a loss of $69.3 million. That\u2019s just above estimates from last year but well below tracking of over $600 million for the year. Overall, Twitter has lost $418.6 million since it began. Twitter will be offering up 472,613,753 shares of stock in this initial release. Twitter says that it currently has 218.3 million monthly active users, and those users have created over 300 billion tweets. That MAU number is significantly lower than many had expected at this point as they announced that they had 200 million MAUs in December. Twitter says that it delivers over 200 billion tweets per day. Twitter says that 75 percent of its MAUs access the service from mobile devices (that\u2019s 161.25 million) and that 65 percent of all of its ad revenues come from mobile. This marks a big contrast to Facebook, which had no revenues in mobile at all when it filed for IPO. Twitter says that in the second quarter of 2013 there were approximately 30 billion \u2018online impressions\u2019 of tweets off of its properties. The companies\u2019 current estimates put spam accounts at under 5 percent of MAUs, but says that this may not be accurate. On the employment front, Twitter says that it has gained over 900 employees in the year since June 2012, an increase of 90 percent. It currently employs over 2,000 people. Twitter\u2019s IPO has been a hotly anticipated event for some months now, with news of Twitter\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d filing coming via a tweet last month . The stealth filing was made possible by the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) act, which allows companies with less than $1 billion in revenue to file for an IPO without exposing the details immediately. Twitter lists a number of risk factors in the filing, noting that the business could be harmed if \u201cinfluential users, such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets and brands or certain age demographics\u201d conclude that an alternative product or service is more relevant; they are unable to convince potential new users of the value and usefulness of our products and services; or\u00a0they are unable to combat spam or other hostile or inappropriate usage on the platform.

That dual class structure effectively means that a small number of people can control a public company, even if they don\u2019t own a majority of the company\u2019s shares. You can argue the pros and cons of that structure , but it\u2019s quite common. And it\u2019s why people ranging from the Sulzberger family (New York Times) to Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) to Sergey Brin and Larry Page (Google) get to run what are in many ways private companies, even though their shares trade publicly: There\u2019s almost no chance an outsider can buy up shares and push them around. But Twitter, which is both a media and a tech company, isn\u2019t following in their footsteps. The company\u2019s S-1 notes that it has only one class of shares. So Dick Costolo and Evan Williams aren\u2019t given any special powers \u2014 their shares entitle them to the same voting power that your shares give you. The messaging here is clear: \u201cAt Twitter,\u201d the company\u2019s filing would like to say but can\u2019t because it can\u2019t actually speak, \u201cwe are way more responsive to shareholder interests than many of our peers.\u201d There\u2019s a caveat, of course: Twitter\u2019s board retains the right to issue preferred stock, which could indeed come with special voting rights and other powers.\u00a0It\u2019s the kind of thing you might see employed if a corporate raider like Carl Icahn ever showed up at the door with big ideas.

Today, the social microblogging company that started out its life as another product altogether unveiled its S-1 documents for its public offering of $1 billion. Its symbol will be TWTR, but Twitter did not say where its stock would be traded. In its filing, the company went very cute, with an image of its first tweet by co-founder and Twitter creator Jack Dorsey, noting, \u201cTwitter was born on March 21, 2006 with just 24 characters.\u201d It also included images of tweets from everyone from President Barack Obama to Wheat Thins to the one from Clarence House announcing the new royal baby in England. More importantly, this is the first look at the business of the privately held San Francisco-based Twitter. Revenue for 2012 was $316.9 million. For the first half of 2013, $253.6 million. The company lost $79.4 million in 2012 and lost $69.3 million in the first half of 2013. But, on an adjusted basis, Twitter noted in its filing: \u201cFrom 2011 to 2012, revenue increased by 198% to $316.9 million, net loss decreased by 38% to $79.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 149% to $21.2 million. From the six months ended June 30, 2012 to the six months ended June 30, 2013, revenue increased by 107% to $253.6 million, net loss increased by 41% to $69.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $20.7 million to $21.4 million.\u201d In other words, it is slowly making money, at least from a cash flow perspective. Expectations of revenue were pegged at just about $600 million this year and close to $300 million last year. In the filing, Twitter said it had 215 million active users, or those that use the service at least once a month, sending out 500 million tweets daily. It said in December that it had 200 million. As of midyear, Twitter said it had $164.4 million in cash or cash equivalents. As to the big owners of Twitter, pre-IPO: CEO Dick Costolo with 7.6 million shares, co-founder and chairman Jack Dorsey with 23.4 million shares, co-founder and former CEO and director Evan Williams with 56.9 million shares. Director Peter Fenton held 31.6 million shares for Benchmark Capital. The other big holders, called \u201c5% Stockholders,\u201d include, as I had previously reported: Rizvi Traverse, Spark Capital, Benchmark, Union Square Partners and DST Global. Shares are expected to trade starting in November, which it can do after a 21-day period after the public filing. But it could also delay that, especially if markets suffer due to the recent government shutdown. Twitter is far along in the IPO process, having filed financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. It has since been going back and forth with regulators on issues, confidentially, part of a filing process for companies with revenue of less than $1 billion under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. It released news of the filing in September via \u2014 of course \u2014 a tweet. Twitter will now go on a public road show for investors, although it has been in talks with a number of them already as part of the process. Here are the bankers, for those who care about such things (only the bankers): Goldman Sachs in the lead, with Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as well as smaller players, Allen &amp; Co. and Code Advisors. Here is Twitter\u2019s inevitable tweet about the filing: Our S-1 will be filed publicly with the SEC momentarily. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale. \u2014 Twitter (@twitter) October 3, 2013 And, in its short letter to potential shareholders from @twitter, the company said: We started with a simple idea: share what you\u2019re doing, 140 characters at a time.

The company filed the official IPO documents several weeks ago under the new JOBS Act, which allows companies with a market value of less than $1 billion to keep their filing hidden from public view for at least three weeks. The company said it plans to raise a maximum of $1 billion in the offering, but didn\u2019t say which exchange it will be trading on. Twitter announced on September 12 that it had filed the S-1 with the SEC , but multiple reports said the filing was actually made much earlier, possibly as early as July. In a letter to shareholders, the company said: \u201cThe mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve\u2013and do not detract from\u2013a free and global conversation.\u201d According to the SEC filing, Twitter had $316 million in revenue last year or more than 10 times what it had in 2010. In the six months ended in June, it had revenue of $253 million, or more than twice what it had in the same period of 2012 \u2014 but it recorded a loss of $69 million. In 2012 it lost $49 million. The company said it had free cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $21 million in the first six months of this year. Market value expected to be $15B plus A number of observers speculated before the filing that Twitter could launch its public offering at between $28 and $30 a share , which would give the company a market value of more than $15 billion. Earlier this year, when Blackrock Ventures acquired shares from employees and early investors in a private transaction, the company was valued at about $9 billion \u2014 and in 2011, when Russian venture fund DST Global bought shares, it was valued at $8 billion. An IPO is expected to make several early investors and insiders billionaires, including former CEO Evan Williams and venture investor Chris Sacca. Some early venture groups could also wind up with stakes worth $1 billion or more, including Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital. Twitter has raised a little over $1 billion so far, with some of that being sales by employees and early backers. In the S-1, Twitter says $221 million of the total $253 million in revenue it brought in during the first half of this year came from advertising \u2014 the rest from data licensing. Earlier estimates from industry groups such as eMarketer had estimated that Twitter could make as much as $580 million this year from advertising, which is its main source of revenue. Under the \u201crisk factors\u201d category, Twitter said: \u201cTo the extent our user growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement and ad engagement on Twitter. If people do not perceive our products and services to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract users or increase the frequency of their engagement with our platform and the ads that we display.\u201d Over 215 million active users per month The SEC document says that Twitter has 215 million active users per month, and that 75 percent of them access the service on a mobile device. The company had previously said that it has about 200 million users, although there were no details provided previously about the number of active users, as opposed to dormant accounts. According to the S-1 the service has 100 million daily active users. Some have estimated that the number of fake or automated spam accounts could be as high as 10 percent of the overall number, but Twitter says it is actually 5 percent (although it admits this is an estimate based on a sample). Under risk factors, the S-1 says: \u201cWe anticipate that our user growth rate will slow over time as the size of our user base increases.\u201d Evan Williams According to the S-1 filing, co-founder Jack Dorsey owns just under 5 percent of the company, co-founder and former CEO Ev Williams owns 12 percent and current CEO Dick Costolo owns 1.6 percent. If the stock trades in the expected range of $28 to $30 per share, Williams\u2019s stake would be worth approximately $1.7 billion and Dorsey\u2019s would be worth $700 million. More than the number of users, Twitter\u2019s future rests on the amount of engagement it can show those users having with content from advertisers \u2014 and the data it can provide to those advertisers and partners such as TV networks. The company recently launched a feature called \u201cTwitter Amplify\u201d that allows it to target ads towards users who have been watching a specific TV show, and it has acquired a number of companies such as Bluefin that can crunch that data. One of the big question marks for Twitter is how much bottom-line value that kind of relationship can actually produce, and whether Facebook \u2014 which has also been making a similar pitch to TV networks and advertisers about its value as a social-sharing pipeline \u2014 will be able to steal some of its thunder .

The initial public offering marks the first time that Twitter has been required to make much of its financial data public, and it shows a company that is growing its revenue but still hasn't quite turned a profit. The SEC filing says that Twitter has 218 million monthly active users, up from 200 million in December 2012. The company also says it has seen a 198 percent growth in year-over-year revenue, bringing in $316.9 million in 2012, and a 38 percent decrease in net loss to $79.4 million. For the first half of 2013, the company brought in $253.6 million in revenue and its net loss was tallied at $69.3 million. AllThingsD reminds us that expectations for Twitter's revenues \u201cwere pegged at just about $600 million this year and close to $300 million last year.\u201d So Twitter's IPO will be small, at least compared to Facebook's recent IPO , in which the company said it expected to raise $13 billion on 337,415,352 shares of stock. But Facebook's shares stumbled quite a bit when the company finally got out on the track, with some investors claiming that the company had been overvalued. It has only relatively recently found its footing.

Eyeing a major growth of its office space, Twitter is in discussions with real-estate developer Shorenstein Properties to lease more than 300,000 square feet in a building that neighbors its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco's Mid-Market neighborhood near City Hall, according to multiple people briefed on the talks. No lease has been signed, and the landlord continues to talk to other potential tenants for the space in the 10-story building known as 1Tenth, the people said. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment. The discussions suggest an aggressive growth plan: The space would nearly double Twitter's existing footprint and could accommodate more than 2,000 additional employees\u2014roughly the size of its existing global workforce. The company first leased about 215,000 square feet at 1355 Market Street\u2014a former furniture mart built in the 1930s\u2014from Shorenstein in 2011. At the time, Twitter's lease was considered a path-breaking move for the gritty Mid-Market neighborhood. It subsequently moved into another 85,000 square feet in the building, and it has exercised options for additional space that would bring its total to about 400,000 square feet. City officials have tried for decades to spruce up the neighborhood, long populated by a large number of homeless people and payday loan shops. But Twitter's move in 2011 and incentives put in place by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee helped unleash a wave of tech-company migration to the area. New entrants include mobile-payment company Square Inc. and corporate-focused social-networking company Yammer Inc. \u2014Yoree Koh contributed to this article Write to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com A version of this article appeared October 3, 2013, on page B5 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Twitter Seeks to Expand in San Francisco.", "lede": "As it gears up for an initial public offering, social-media giant...", "link": "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304176904579111834120993134.html"}, {"author": "Ryan Tate", "title": "Twitter Files for IPO, Shows $317M in Revenue", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 22:23:00", "content": "Twitter has filed to go public, saying it will sell shares under the name TWTR. The IPO will initially seek to raise up to $1 billion. In its first public disclosure of financial performance, Twitter revealed it is growing revenue fast but losing money. In a registration filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, known as a \u201cform S-1,\u201d Twitter says its revenue increased to $316.9 million in 2012, from $106 million in 2011. Its net loss for 2012 was $79 million. In the first six months of this year, according to the filing, it pulled in $253.7 million in revenue, up from $122 million in the first six months of 2012. But its losses appear to be widening. The company lost $69 million in the first six months of this year, not far from its total loss for all of last year. The company said it had 218.3 million users per month, on average, for the three-month period ended in June. That\u2019s up from 85 million users per month in the same period last year. Before going public, the company must first wait through a three-week quiet period. After a \u201croad show\u201d that markets shares, Twitter and its underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs, will set a price for them. Twitter stock won\u2019t be available to the public, then, until November. Twitter had reportedly been planning to raise $1.5 billion with an offering of 50 million to 55 million shares priced at $28 to $30 each. Its 2013 revenue had been estimated at $545 million by eMarketer, set to rise to $807 million in 2014. Twitter said more than 65 percent of its advertising revenue came from mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. Because mobile advertising revenue is growing much more quickly than desktop advertising revenue in developed markets like the U.S., some believe Twitter has as a significant advantage over rivals like Facebook, which gleaned just 41 percent of ad revenue from mobile in its most recent quarter. Twitter\u2019s IPO filing marks its first release of revenue and profit figures, providing an unprecedented glimpse into the company\u2019s financial health and growth prospects. More broadly, the filing sets the tone for one of the most anticipated IPOs in the current tech boom, matched only by the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn. Enthusiasm for Twitter shares could encourage more tech companies to go public rather than wait or sell themselves to larger competitors. Among the companies rumored to be weighing an IPO this year are enterprise storage firm Box; big data outfit Palantir; payment provider Square, which shares co-founder Jack Dorsey with Twitter; marketing software company HubSpot; and discount retailer Gilt. Launched in 2006 as a way to circulate text messages among groups, Twitter quickly expanded beyond the California tech cognoscenti to become a global phenomenon, with everyone from Hollywood celebrities to world political leaders to political dissidents trading messages via the web, smartphone apps, and SMS messages. But Twitter repeatedly hit scaling and stability problems and was slow to monetize its popularity. That helps explain why Twitter\u2019s IPO will be much smaller than Facebook\u2019s $16 billion offering in May 2012. Twitter\u2019s lower revenue did help it in one regard: Since the company\u2019s annual sales are below $1 billion, it was able to submit a draft version of its S-1 to federal regulators back in July and was then presumably able to incorporate the feds\u2019 confidential feedback into the final S-1 filed today. Typically, draft filings and SEC feedback are submitted in full public view, but under the recently-enacted JOBS Act smaller companies like Twitter may keep the process private.", "lede": "Twitter has filed to go public, saying it will sell shares under ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/twitter-files-for-ipo-2/"}]}, {"cluster": 19, "articles": [{"author": "Catherine Shu", "title": "WeLend Brings Online Social Lending To Hong Kong", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:31:40", "content": "Founded by WeLab, a finance startup, WeLend is the first social lending platform based in Hong Kong. Since launching in early July, WeLab says it has received US$4 million in loan applications. The social, or peer-to-peer, lending industry in the U.S. has existed since 2006, when Prosper and Lending Club were both founded. In mainland China, prominent peer-to-peer lending platforms include Creditease , SinoLending and PPDai . Despite Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international financial center, however, there were no peer-to-peer lending platforms before WeLend launched. Simon Loong, the founder and CEO of WeLab, says the startup is currently focused on educating potential borrowers about WeLend\u2019s services. Loong hopes his fifteen years in the banking industry, including a position as North East Asia Regional Head of Unsecured Lending at Standard Chartered Bank, will help WeLend gain credibility and grow. Though informal lending clubs are common in Hong Kong, barriers to entry for peer-to-peer platforms include stringent financial regulations and competition from dominant players in the banking industry such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citicorp. \u201cIn the past when you resided in the same village, you\u2019d lend money to one another. That\u2019s the essential concept behind the peer-to-peer model,\u201d says Loong. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting fact that we hear often when we do user education. People say that their grandfather\u2019s generation did this in their village. Now we are looking at how we can scale that model by using our banking experience.\u201d \u00a0 WeLab holds a money lenders license in Hong Kong and currently only accepts loans from lenders in the company\u2019s private network. WeLend assesses potential borrowers based their credit rating, as well as information such as income, occupation and property ownership. To optimize returns on its portfolio, WeLend currently only approves 20% of loan applicants. Many of WeLend\u2019s applicants want to consolidate debt and the platform also targets small-to-medium businesses seeking to borrow money. Its typical loan amount is currently US$10,000 to US$20,000 for a 24-month term. Like Prosper and LendingClub, WeLend entices borrowers by offering lower interest rates than banks and other traditional financial institutions. The platform says its annual percentage rate (APR) ranges from 3% to 25%, compared to 7% to 35% offered by banks or 10% to 60% offered by consumer finance companies. Another attraction for borrowers is WeLend\u2019s one-day application process, compared to the five to seven days required by many banks. \u201cSo far we have US$4 million in loan applications, and momentum is good,\u201d says Loong. \u201cIt took us 45 days to reach the first million, and 15 days to get to the second million in applications.\u201d WeLab\u2019s next step is exploring how to scale up WeLend by understanding regulations and borrowing behaviors in different Asian countries. Loong says by targeting smaller, mature markets, WeLend has an advantage over peer-to-peer lending platforms in larger countries like U.S., China and UK. \u201cThere are few mature Asian markets and knowing how to do one market doesn\u2019t give you scalability. It\u2019s still a relatively new concept for the U.S., China and UK,\u201d says Loong. \u201cThey still have a long way to go domestically before international expansion, but we know the local, mature Asian markets.\u201d In addition to WeLend, WeLab will focus on building other online products that \u201cdemocratize finance.\u201d The startup has already raised a round of seed funding from private investors and is planning to raise a Series A in the first half of 2014. WeLab operates WeLend, Hong Kong\u2019s first peer-to-peer lending platform. Our ultimate goal is to provide people with the opportunity to borrow, invest, and connect through a secure, professional, and efficient platform. By removing expensive middlemen and other complexities from our business model, we make securing a personal loan easy and affordable.

It isn\u2019t clear exactly how the two operating systems would share the handset, in terms of allowing dual-booting or making a user choose a default at device setup, but it\u2019s a sign Redmond may be thinking about pulling out all the stops to get people using its mobile OS. These talks are in very early stages, according to Bloomberg\u2019s sources, and there\u2019s a possibility that Microsoft may even reduce or eliminate its licensing fee for Windows Phone to make it more attractive to HTC. HTC seems to be a target because it\u2019s a former partner that has already built both Windows and Android hardware (though it doesn\u2019t seem to be too keen on delivering more on the Windows Phone side). Microsoft\u2019s head of Operating Systems Terry Myerson is said to be heading to Taiwan to discuss the arrangement in further detail with HTC, says Bloomberg. There are a couple of reasons this makes sense, including some information TechCrunch has heard about Microsoft and its organizational sentiment towards Android. First, HTC has been one of Microsoft\u2019s few hardware partners for Windows Phone, and that relationship is likely strained given the Nokia hardware division purchase. Second, HTC is in a bad way in terms of continuing poor financial performance, and in terms of device sales, so it\u2019s probably very willing to consider unorthodox models to help it gain some unique appeal for users. As to what we\u2019ve heard about internal feelings on Android at Microsoft, a source suggests that there are contingents of younger engineers at the company who pushed hard to have Android/Windows dual-booting on Surface tablet devices, so there\u2019s a willingness to experiment with things very much like this HTC dual-OS smartphone. Those ideas, TechCrunch has been told, came from younger elements within Microsoft\u2019s mobile engineering team, and were not embraced by the older more established elements of senior management. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is leaving within the next year, he announced back in August, and there have been other big executive shifts at the company lately, too, including the departure of Xbox head Don Mattrick and Windows lead Steven Sinofsky. This may have changed the culture enough at Microsoft to allow some of the more radical new ideas to gain better purchase, which could result in an HTC device that lets users choose not one, but two mobile operating systems with one device buy. Launch Date: 1997 IPO: April 4, 2002, TPE:2498 HTC Corp, (TAIEX: 2498) produces smartphones running the Android and Windows Phone 8 operating systems for themselves and as an OEM to other manufacturers.

Something that shows just how crazy talented you and your teammates are. Remember: this is a Hackathon. Our judges wont be looking for the thing with the best potential business model \u2014 they\u2019re looking for something that makes them stop and say \u201c Whoa. \u201c We\u2019re changing things up a bit this time around. Since it\u2019s our first big event outside of the US in some time, we\u2019re keepin\u2019 the attendee list for this Hackathon a bit smaller than its stateside counterparts. We\u2019ve got a newly polished set of rules to keep things fair and to help make sure everyone at the event has a great time and, like all of TechCrunch\u2019s upcoming events, our anti-harassment policy is in full effect here. Oh, and just to sweeten the deal a bit more: even if you don\u2019t take one of the top three spots or win one of the awesome API sponsor prizes, there\u2019s still something great up for grabs. Each of the top 40-or-so teams (with the final number depending on how many teams enter) who present will get two tickets to the entirety of the Disrupt Europe conference, normally valued at nearly $1k each. Why? Because we think you\u2019re rad. As long as you\u2019re building something, participating in the Hackathon is free. Interested sponsors, give us a shout . We released the first batch of tickets last week, and it was by far the biggest batch we\u2019ll release. Every batch we release will get smaller and smaller \u2014 so if you\u2019re looking to attend, make sure you register quick.

As music streaming services around the world face down the international expansion of Spotify and Deezer , Dhingana CEO Rohit Bhatia says the startup is hedging its bets on a mobile-first strategy as well as growth in international markets. Over 75% of its users access its one-million song library from mobile devices, which the startup says marks a 200% growth year-over-year. Dhingana, which is based in Pune, India and Sunnyvale, Ca., says half of its monthly active users come from outside of India. The U.S. accounts for most of that number, with 2.5 million users, while 1 million access the service from Europe and the U.K. Within India, Dhingana\u2019s cross-platform strategy is tailored for the country\u2019s fragmented mobile marketplace, where featurephones still dominate but smartphone shipments are growing rapidly . According to Dhingana, its apps have been downloaded over 6 million times across Android, iOS, Windows 8, BlackBerry, Nokia and Amazon Kindle platforms. CEO Rohit Bhatia says Dhingana has achieve most of its growth from organic traffic and spends almost nothing on marketing. The service, however, faces several major competitors. Though Spotify and Deezer have not launched in India yet, both are focusing on international expansion \u00a0and India\u2019s fast-growing Internet user base presents an attractive opportunity.\u00a0Dhingana\u2019s main domestic competitors include Saavn and Gaana , both of which also want to leverage international growth. For example, Saavn, which\u00a0claimed 10 million monthly active visitors at the beginning of this year , is taking a double-pronged approach to user acquisition by offering an English-language service for foreign audiences with a taste for Bollywood music while building its catalog of Western tracks for Indian listeners. Gaana, a music streaming service backed by\u00a0 Times Internet , one of India\u2019s largest Internet companies,\u00a0 says international audiences make up a large part of its user base . Other Indian streaming music services include Raaga and MusicIndiaOnline.CO . Bhatia says Dhingana\u2019s competitive advantage is offering a vast array of music for every language and region in India with tracks in more than 42 languages and genres. \u201cIt took Dhingana almost over a year and a half to sign licensing agreements with 900-plus labels,\u201d says Bhatia. \u201cIf you want to be a truly Indian music streaming service, you have to sign up with all the regional labels, so it can be pretty time-consuming.\u201d Another advantage it has over international competitors such as Spotify is its network of micropayment methods, which is important because India has a credit card penetration rate of just 1.7% . Dhingana also hopes its mobile-first strategy will help it attract listeners. In addition to a mobile-optimized site, it also has Web apps for Opera and UC Browser, two of India\u2019s top mobile browsers. Once users switch to smartphones, Dhingana sends a push notification prompting them to download the app for their operating system. Bhatia says Dhingana also focuses on search-engine optimization so its Web site shows up near the top of search results for popular tracks. The service currently monetizes through ads and a premium subscription service called Dhingana Gold , which is in a in-app purchase through its free iOS app . The startup raised a Series B of $7 million in October 2012 from Lightspeed Venture Partners , with participation from previous investors\u00a0Inventus Capital Partners and Helion Venture Partners. Launch Date: 2007 Funding: $7M Dhingana is an Indian on-demand music service that wants its users to discover new traditional Indian and Bollywood music across the globe. Dhingana gives access to millions of songs in more than 35 Indian languages and genres. The service is available for iOS, Blackberry, Google\u2019s Play Store, Nokia Devices and on its homepage.

Being a communication backbone of the web has its pluses and minuses. Twitter gets lots of content syndicated from other sites, but those contributors don\u2019t necessarily visit Twitter or see its ads. That last part is a problem, especially since these blind tweeters count as some of Twitter\u2019s 218.3 million active users. Twitter explains on page 61 of its S-1 filing \u00a0that an \u201cactive user\u201d includes not only people that actually visit its site and mobile apps, but also \u201cTwitter users who logged in and accessed Twitter through\u2026registered third-party applications or websites.\u201d Those users do push content to Twitter that draws people to its feed where it shows ads, so they help the site monetize. But they also aren\u2019t seeing ads themselves. There are tons of ways to syndicate to Twitter. People auto-tweet their blog posts, Tumblr updates and even their Facebook posts. IFTTT and other automation services make this easy. In its pre-monetization phase, getting more content may have been the right bet, and still may be, but it could make Twitter seem larger than it is. \u201cI don\u2019t really go on Twitter anymore but I share my Instagrams there,\u201d a friend told me today. These Insta-pushers are even worse for Twitter than non-visiting contributors from elsewhere, because Instagram pulled support for Twitter Cards. That means rather than lingering on Twitter and viewing Instagrams in-line, people are whisked to Instagram\u2019s website\u2026where they don\u2019t see Twitter ads. My friend is not alone, considering that Twitter listed \u201cthe degree to which users access Twitter content through applications that do not contain our ads\u201d as one of its risks.\u00a0Yet it doesn\u2019t break out users who actually visit its feed from those who don\u2019t. If that number is a significant percentage of Twitter\u2019s total active user count, bankers might want Twitter to disclose it in revisions to its S-1 in the upcoming weeks before it actually goes public.

But its newest market is a little closer to home: Beginning Friday evening, riders in certain parts of Silicon Valley will be able to start requesting rides. Lyft, of course, is incredibly popular in its home market of San Francisco, where it launched and where it\u2019s been operating for the past year and a half. As a result, it\u2019s not surprising to see the company extend the service farther south. After all, with so many people in SF working on the peninsula \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 there was likely a number of people who were able to use Lyft in one place who wished to use it in the other. The launch, which happens tomorrow evening, will expand availability in the South Bay but it won\u2019t totally cover the area. Lyft\u2019s Silicon Valley service stretches from Menlo Park down to San Jose, but at launch it won\u2019t accept rides between the San Francisco city limits and, say, Redwood City. (It will drop off in those areas, so long as the ride originates in SF or farther south in Silicon Valley.) According to Lyft CEO Logan Green, the company is taking the same approach that it took in Los Angeles, its second market. With that launch, the ride-sharing service made itself available in just one specific part of the wide sprawl of the city: Santa Monica and Venice. Later, it expanded to other parts of the city as it felt comfortable with its ability to serve each new neighborhood. In the same way, Lyft decided to light up the \u201cdensest, most-active swath\u201d of the Silicon Valley market and make sure it could provide an adequate level of service there before expanding. It will close the gap between SF and Menlo Park over time \u2014 and eventually, it will likely expand into Oakland and the East Bay to serve the entire \u201cSan Francisco Bay Area.\u201d Lyft expects to see other similarities between Silicon Valley and L.A., like a longer average trip length. Green said that the average trip in cities like San Francisco tends to be about two miles, while in the suburbs you\u2019ll see it be more like four or five miles. But traffic is usually less intense than in the center of major cities. According to Green, Silicon Valley pricing per mile will be tuned down slightly from what San Francisco riders can expect to account for the longer average trip length and less traffic. Green says that Lyft is ramped up for a bigger launch than normal, but that the company expects to be able to meet Silicon Valley demand. In part, that\u2019s because a lot more people in Silicon Valley have cars than those in San Francisco. For a ride-sharing company, one of the advantages of operating in more suburban markets is that the number of potential drivers is a lot higher than in cities where everyone takes public transportation. Lyft has raised $82 million from investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Mayfield Fund, K9 Ventures, and Floodgate. Launch Date: 2007 Funding: $82.5M Your friend with a car\u2122 Lyft is a friendly, safe, affordable transportation option. Download the app for iPhone or Android and request a ride with the tap of a button; a friendly driver will arrive in minutes to take you where you need to go.

The company raised $1.16 billion prior to its planned initial public offering , which could total $1 billion itself. Here\u2019s another figure: Twitter\u2019s accumulated deficit to date is $418.6 million, a figure that will race to $748.2 million once it goes public and realizes\u00a0$329.6 million in costs related to\u00a0stock-based compensation expenses. This is not to say that Twitter has spent $418.6 million to date; that figure is far higher. Accumulated deficit can be viewed as the company\u2019s net income, net loss and paid dividends added together as debits and credits. So the formula is net income, minus net loss, minus paid dividends. Twitter pays no dividends, so its accumulated deficit is simply the amount of money that it has spent\u00a0 more than it has brought in as revenue in its life. In a simple way, it\u2019s the money that Twitter had to raise to keep its lights on during its growth. The company continues to lose money on a GAAP basis, and even on an adjusted net loss scale. So we can expect that Twitter\u2019s accumulated deficit will increase in time. The company doesn\u2019t appear to be operating in a way that would place it on a quick ramp to profitability, its loss rising year over year when the first half of 2013 is compared to the similar period in 2012. Twitter is not alone in having a large accumulated deficit. In 2005, for example, Amazon reported a $2.2 billion accumulated loss . That was a full decade after its birth and eight years after its initial public offering.\u00a0Trulia, by way of another comparison, had an accumulated deficit of $44 million before it went public. If Twitter raised more than $1 billion, but has an accumulated deficit of just $418.6 million, where did the rest of the money go? It still has quite a lot of it left, with cash on hand of $164.5 million and short-term investments of $210.5 million.\u00a0Twitter is about to become far more cash rich, following its offering, but not profitable.

To my utter shock it was the Venue 8 Pro, the company\u2019s first pint-sized Windows 8 tablet. Let\u2019s start with its looks. The lightweight, plastic body screams \u201cgeneric,\u201d and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to differentiate it from the Android-powered cousins we looked at earlier. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s completely devoid of nice touches, though: The back plate features a pattern of concentric circles that break up the monotony of an otherwise plain soft-touch finish and seems to help with grip. The Venue 8 Pro is unexpectedly light, too, as it weighs a relatively scant .87 pounds \u2014 that\u2019s well within striking distance of the iPad mini. That said, the Venue 8 Pro suffers from a distinct lack of style. It\u2019s perhaps to be expected considering that this is Dell\u2019s first attempt at bringing a full-on Windows 8 experience to a device like this, and there\u2019s a lot that could go wrong with this sort of endeavor. Take the screen, for instance. One of my favorite reviews ever written features Paul Thurrott just eviscerating Acer\u2019s Windows 8-powered Iconia W3 tablet for its godawful screen. Some may say he was too heavy-handed in his criticism, but when the primary means of consuming and interacting with your content just sucks, something is very very wrong. Thankfully, early stinkers like the Acer make Dell\u2019s approach seem all the more palatable. The Pro\u2019s IPS screen \u2014 which ran at 1280 x 800 \u2014 was bright and well-saturated, and viewing angles seemed more than respectable during the brief moments I spent playing with the thing. Of course, the screen\u2019s size poses some issues. There\u2019s no denying that parts of Windows 8.1 just aren\u2019t suited for such small displays. The classic desktop mode is cramped and festooned with tiny icons that require a fair amount of dexterity to poke at accurately. Dell plans to downplay some of those issues by selling an active stylus that allows for precise manipulation of screen elements \u2014 I took that thing for a spin too and came away impressed. Part of the stylus\u2019s appeal is because Dell fought the urge to make it small enough to slot into the Venue\u2019s chassis. Instead the company opted to make a full-sized pen, which helps dramatically with usability (though you\u2019ll have to tuck it into a case or a pocket). And then there\u2019s longevity to consider. I\u2019m told that the battery is slated to last between 8 and 10 hours of normal use (whatever that is). That wouldn\u2019t amount to much if this thing wound up trading off performance for power, but the whole package seemed suitably snappy thanks to its 1.8GHz quad-core Intel Bay Trail chipset. We\u2019ll see if that remains the case once the final devices start trickling out into the wild. After being let down in such a big way by Microsoft\u2019s original Surface RT, I thought I\u2019d never splurge on a Windows tablet again. Now, after having played with Dell\u2019s attempt, I find myself rethinking my earlier position. The prospect of running full Windows apps on a device this light and this cheap is a terribly attractive one, and at this moment Dell\u2019s tiny tab seems well-equipped to take on what few Windows competitors are playing at this size. I may even buy this thing over the iPad mini, which is yet another thing I never thought I\u2019d say. Stay tuned for the full review in short order.

As with every S-1 filing, the company reports which individuals/firms hold the most shares in the company. According to this table , founder Evan Williams owns 12 percent of the company before the offering. Benchmark and the firm\u2019s partner and board member Peter Fenton owns 6.7 percent. Fellow founder Jack Dorsey owns 4.9 percent and CEO Dick Costolo owns 1.6 percent. Other stock holders that own 5 percent or more of the company include Rizvi Traverse (which is reportedly backed by Chris Sacca ), Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and DST. It\u2019s not clear how much each investor owns specifically. Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital were Twitter\u2019s earliest institutional investors (USV led the company\u2019s first major round, and Spark Capital led Twitter\u2019s second round), as was Charles River Ventures, who is not listed in the table and put in around $250,000 early on.

We\u2019re also hearing that after Rizvi, Williams is the next largest single shareholder followed by Benchmark, Spark, USV and then DST.

In the S-1 form that the company filed today for its public offering, Twitter called mobile the \u201cprimary driver of our business.\u201d It said that 75% of its 218.3 million+ monthly active users are accessing the site from mobile devices \u2014 or 161.25 million users. And mobile accounts for 65% of all its ad revenues. All in all, the word \u201cmobile\u201d comes up 130 times in the 160+ page document. From the intro to the filing: Mobile has become the primary driver of our business. Our mobile products are critical to the value we create for our users, and they enable our users to create, distribute and discover content in the moment and on-the-go. The 140 character constraint of a Tweet emanates from our origins as an SMS-based messaging system, and we leverage this simplicity to develop products that seamlessly bridge our user experience across all devices. In the three months ended June 30, 2013, 75% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device, including mobile phones and tablets, and over 65% of our advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. We expect that the proportion of active users on, and advertising revenue generated from, mobile devices, will continue to grow in the near term. If you recall, when Facebook filed its S-1 before going public, the company had no revenues in mobile and made a big point of spelling that out, with 425 million of its 845 million monthly active users accessing the service from mobile devices (those are from the initial S-1, which got revised up several times before the company finally listed). Twitter is in a significantly different position. Not only does the company have a majority of its users accessing from mobile devices, but it already make a majority of its ad revenues from these platforms. (The main ad unit currently on Android and iOS, Promoted Products, was introduced in February 2012.) While there have been a lot of changes to the basic desktop product over the last couple of years, in 2013 you could argue that the biggest product moves that Twitter has made have been in mobile, from the launch of the Vine video app (to follow through on the photo filters that it launched near the end of 2012) through to its experiments with Twitter Music (also a mobile app), and its acquisition of MoPub (a specialist in mobile ad-tech). Twitter pretty much says it all about mobile and its ambitions to push the envelope in that area, in a bit of very typical S-1 jargon: \u201cIf new or enhanced products or services fail to engage users and advertisers, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue or operating profit to justify our investments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\u201d With 130 mentions of mobile in the S-1, here are a few of the interesting points that jumped out at me in a first reading: \u2013 The big threat in mobile for Twitter is in Asia . Specifically, it pinpoints the rise of multiple local messaging apps. \u201cIncreased competition from local websites, mobile applications and services that provide real-time communications, such as Sina Weibo in China, LINE in Japan and Kakao in South Korea, which have expanded and may continue to expand their geographic footprint,\u201d it writes. \u2013 Mobile can be misleading . \u201cOur metrics are also affected by mobile applications that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved, and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs.\u201d \u2013 Mobile growth .

While mobile still represents a seemingly small percentage of overall revenue \u2014 generally between two percent and 10 percent depending on the business \u2014 the growth rate is impossible to deny. A recent study by IBM found that mobile commerce grew by 31 percent in Q1 of 2013, outpacing all e-commerce at 20 percent and in-store at 3.7 percent. Any statistician will tell you that percentages are only as good as their perspective size, coercing many marketing strategies to focus on other \u201cchannels.\u201d However \u2014 to be blunt \u2014 mobile is not a channel. It begins, reinforces and sometimes completes all channels. By not understanding the influence that mobile devices exert in all revenue centers, any company is susceptible to losing revenue at 25 times that of direct mobile revenue. Applying research from a March 2013 Deloitte study , mobile can influence traditional in-store purchases by an astounding 17x. In addition, BloomReach\u2019s internal data anonymously connecting mobile and Web usage on the same merchant shows that mobile can influence a desktop e-commerce channel by up to 7x. So, hypothetically, a company that loses $10 million in yearly mobile revenue that provides poor mobile experiences stands to lose $70 million from desktop revenue and an additional $170 million from in-store purchases \u2014 totaling a whopping $250 million. Think it\u2019s not possible? Well, a recent Harris poll found that 90 percent of consumers think negatively of a brand if they have poorly performing mobile experiences, and Google found that 61 percent of consumers will leave a mobile site immediately if they don\u2019t find what they want right away. While many companies have responded with a mobile \u201cskin\u201d around traditional websites using responsive design or mobile proxy solutions, consumers want more relevant, more intuitive content in less time. Each situation is obviously unique, but below I\u2019ll discuss five elements to consider and understand when taking a mobile-centric view of brand-to-consumer experiences. Mobile is the channel \u201cglue\u201d Have you ever taken a moment to look up at a group of passengers waiting to board a plane, heads bowed with the dull reflection of a mobile-device screen on their face? Probably not, because you also were checking your email, perusing social media or reading the newest gadget review on AllThingsD . Mobile devices \u2014 especially smartphones \u2014 are the most personal device in history. Constantly tethered to your side, they help you compare prices, find brick-and-mortar locations or see what your friends are interested in buying. Thus, understanding traffic origin can provide you with distinct clues behind the nature of a shopper. For example, analyzing metrics like time-on-site, bounce rates and number of pages discovered from each channel (even while in-store) can intuitively advise you about the best content and site navigation to provide. You have a data problem, not a design problem What good is a beautiful mobile site when product discovery is frustrating, causing visitors to leave in aggravation? It sounds obvious, but that\u2019s one of the top frustrations that lead to lost sales and negative brand associations on mobile sites. Companies have invested thousands into building gorgeous imagery, social features and catchy copy, but mobile sites ultimately boil down to utility and relevance. In a perfect world, we could just access a Siri-like interface that easily interprets our language and automatically determines our intentions, returning appropriate results and suggestions that fit our patterns and past behavior. While I\u2019m speaking somewhat futuristically, the underlying point is the same. Being able to collect, correctly predict and intuitively respond to the data/signals provided by shoppers is key to maximizing conversions. If done well, shopping on a mobile device can feel like browsing through a brick-and-mortar store with a personal shopper helping you to get closer and closer to the perfect product. Conversely, if the data is poor or incorrectly interpreted, then shoppers can be left with a frustrating series of dead-end searches and irrelevant products. For example, just because a visitor\u2019s time-on-site is high doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re satisfied. They could be aimlessly bouncing from page to page through category hierarchies \u2014 a common characteristic of infrastructures built for desktops a decade ago. Email is mobile American Eagle Outfitters recently cited that 70 percent of its loyalty emails are opened on a mobile device. While optimizing emails to be viewed on a smartphone may be a no-brainer, it\u2019s more important to correlate the mobile-site experience when they click through. A landing page should be consistent with the email look, feel, content and offer. With what content did they engage, and are there easily accessible links to other elements of the email offer? We are bombarded by marketing emails daily, so unlike other channels, consumers give very valuable insight simply because they are inspired by the subject line. Even if they ultimately don\u2019t access content directly in-line with the ever-important subject line , providing a dynamic experience that promotes effortless discovery of the intended purpose gives invaluable information \u2014 which includes engaging a loyal mobile shopper after the first landing page. However, one thing is certain. With email click-through rates hovering around 4.5 percent , one or two bad landing pages following an email click-through will leave you in the other 94.5 percent or completely opted-out. Location, location, location Store locators are still one of the top reasons that consumers visit mobile sites. However, it\u2019s important to remember that shoppers use their smartphones at every step on the path to purchase, including in a physical location. A retailer must connect users\u2019 location-based signals with items in stock and correct prices. There is nothing more frustrating than finding the perfect product on sale in the right size only to find out that the item is out of stock at the desired location. This makes real-time data integration extremely important. Consumers don\u2019t care if a company \u201cjust ran out\u201d or is \u201cexpecting a shipment.\u201d And, if a mobile shopper is looking at a product page (especially on an in-store Wi-Fi network, which 36.5 percent use to connect to that same store\u2019s website \u2014 the No. 1 mobile destination for the in-store shopper), help them find out where they can buy it right away or provide an expected delivery time, if absolutely necessary. Checkout While mobile commerce has seen tremendous growth, consumers are still extremely uncomfortable with whipping out a credit card while on the go. Clumsy fingers and security concerns severely limit the full revenue potential. As much as 90 percent of consumers don\u2019t log into a brand\u2019s sites (mobile or Web), so checkout should be convenient and fully functioning (e.g., avoid too many pop-up steps or unclear completion notices), without scary and invasive tactics. Consider having simple integrations with a device\u2019s email or social-messaging functions where a consumer can be reminded about intended purchases or liked items. Plus, it\u2019s a good way to combine past behavioral data to make enhanced and deeper product discovery more relevant. These are just five of the top things to consider and constantly improve. But the types of available data, ways to slice it and methods to act upon it far exceed where responsive design or mobile-commerce platforms have taken the mobile-commerce industry thus far. It was a good place to start, but it has become more the norm rather than the solution. The differentiating factors lie in the data a brand can crunch and integrate externally, in concert with internal data across channels. In the end \u2014 at least to this point \u2014 mobile is the connective tissue that binds together all marketing efforts, and can make or break any initiative. With giants like Amazon and Walmart Labs investing billions on technology to churn through terabytes of data where every nuance of consumer experience is optimized, developing data-driven strategies that are mobile-centric provides the best chance for survival.

But he\u2019s not making a CEO salary. In August, Costolo reduced his annual take-home compensation to a mere $14,000 annually, down from the $200,000 yearly comp that he and president of global revenue Adam Bain each received in 2012. While it may be more than the $1 a year salary that Mark Zuckerberg gives himself, it\u2019s no fat monthly paycheck. (And perhaps it\u2019s a nod to Twitter\u2019s famous tweet character limit of 140 characters.) Granted, there\u2019s one big caveat: Costolo is taking most of his pay in Twitter shares. Last year Costolo made $11.5 million, most of which came from stock and option awards. Costolo has also sold some shares. Along with chairman Jack Dorsey and COO Ali Rowghani, he sold some stock in 2011 to Yuri Milner\u2019s DST Global and investor Rizvi Traverse. Worth noting: Of the three highest-paid people on Twitter\u2019s executive compensation table, one in particular stands out. Christopher Fry, Twitter\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, made $10.34 million in 2012 (again, almost entirely from stock awards) \u2014 apparently more than CTO Adam Messinger, CFO Mike Gupta and COO Rowghani. As I noted in March, Messinger poached Fry from Salesforce back in 2012 , originally to work on infrastructure. But eventually, Fry made his way to working on consumer applications. Perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s considered so important \u2014 at least in terms of salary.

But Williams and Stone have moved on. And under current CEO Dick Costolo, Twitter has very quickly become an advertising company. Twitter only formally started selling ads in April 2010 , about six months after Costolo joined the company, originally as chief operating officer. But those were basically tests, and Twitter only generated $7.3 million in ad revenue that year. The next year, that number leapt to $77.7 million, and last year Twitter\u2019s ad salesforce generated $269.4 million. This year, the company may come close to doubling last year\u2019s number: In the first half of 2013, Twitter sold more than $221 million worth of ads. (Click chart to enlarge.) That\u2019s a very nice-looking ramp, and that\u2019s very much part of a plan. Twitter\u2019s sales team, lead by chief revenue officer Adam Bain, has argued for a while that it could have made more money, earlier, but that it wanted to bring in advertisers slowly \u2014 both because the company needed to make sure it had stuff it could sell them, and also because they wanted a nice-looking ramp. So mission accomplished, optically: With an eye on Facebook\u2019s struggles in the last couple years, Twitter has also made a point of noting that the service is in large part a mobile service, and that its ads have always worked for mobile users. In the second quarter of this year, Twitter notes, 65 percent of its ad revenue came from Apple iOS and Google Android devices.

That number, according to sources, could be closer to what Twitter\u2019s actual MAU number is today. Regardless: Stack that up against Facebook\u2019s 815 million monthly active users the company had at the time of its S-1 filing , and it\u2019s clear: Twitter is big, but it\u2019s no social behemoth. Twitter drills down a little bit more on a few other areas: The company sees more than 100 million daily active users, and 75 percent of those access the site from a mobile device. That could be a bright spot for potential investors, who have recently grown more confident in Internet companies\u2019 ability to monetize mobile platforms. On the one hand, Twitter hopes to jumpstart growth in a few ways over the coming months; the company has sent some of its top chiefs abroad to expand international efforts , Twitter\u2019s highest expected areas of growth in the future, according to the S-1. And the company also has a massive redesign in the works to its iOS application , with Android and other mobile platforms likely to follow. That new look could court more mainstream users who have often found the service difficult to crack \u2014 or at least tough to keep coming back to. Of course, there\u2019s a caveat here, too. Twitter just bought MoPub, a mobile advertising platform considered one of the most powerful and effective in the industry. As the S-1 notes, Twitter doesn\u2019t just plan to integrate MoPub\u2019s technology into the existing Twitter advertising platform. Twitter also plans \u201cto grow MoPub\u2019s current business, including by extending advertising across the mobile ecosystem through the MoPub exchange.\u201d In other words, Twitter can still make money by helping other people buy ads \u2014 even if they aren\u2019t Twitter ads. The numbers speak for themselves. Twitter may aim to be the global town square \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly not an overcrowded one. RELATED POSTS:", "lede": "Twitter has a growth problem.

That didn\u2019t happen overnight. The Chinese Internet giant has methodically leapt from online era to era since being founded in 1998, according to company president Martin Lau. Tencent President Martin Lau For instance, a few years ago, Tencent completely reorganized around what was coming next \u2014 moving more than half of its 20,000 employees to focus on mobile, Lau said today at the China 2.0 conference at Stanford University. One of the main results of that effort was the mobile messaging product Weixin. It worked. Weixin had 236 million monthly active users as of this summer, Lau said. But Weixin is part of a larger library of products: QQ instant messenger has 818 million monthly active users, Tencent mail has 274 million, and Tencent Weibo microblogging has 220 monthly active users. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018You have a hodgepodge of different services, so what is the core?\u2019\u201d Lau said. \u201cThe core, I would say, is the comprehensive social infrastructure. At core, we are a social company.\u201d Sure, it might be more convenient for Tencent to have one service to rule them all, Lau admitted. But the portfolio of products emerged over the years, rather than arriving as a fully formed unit. \u201cAll these services came at a different time,\u201d he said. \u201c[Tencent's social network] Qzone came when asynchronous chat became possible. Weixin came when we saw a big wave of mobile Internet coming.\u201d At this point, it would be technically difficult to combine everything and make it all compatible, Lau said \u2014 but Tencent does try to provide a common ID system and a common monetization back end. Tencent had $4.5 billion in revenue in the first half of 2013. Where did it come from? Not advertising, like U.S.-based social networks. Only nine percent of Tencent revenue is based on ads. Seventy percent of revenue comes from user payments, for example for virtual goods, including 53 percent from games. And the rest comes from commerce, Lau said. Focusing on mobile hasn\u2019t paid off yet in revenue, Lau admitted. He cited growth in mobile advertising from Facebook and Twitter, but said that was less applicable for Tencent properties. Lau said he expects that eventually \u201cthe real value is the connection of the phone with businesses offline.\u201d To that end, Tencent has a very active platform for outside developers, with 400,000 registered apps and $500,000 worth of revenue shared with partners so far, Lau said. Many of those are game developers, but they also include Chinese equivalents of Uber, which are shaking up the local taxi industry, and are built within Weixin. What\u2019s next for Tencent is international expansion, and it\u2019s clear that the company is still figuring out how to do that, through a combination of investments and partnerships (mostly in games, but also in things like Fab.com ) and its own product development. For instance, Tencent built an international version of the Weixin mobile messaging app called WeChat, with slightly different code. Lau said WeChat has 100 million registered accounts. (We should flag that this is different from the other stats, as it\u2019s not active users.) How will Tencent break into the U.S.? That question seemed to flummox Lau a bit. It\u2019s clearly a pressing challenge, with no obvious answer. \u201cU.S.\u00a0is a very tough market, U.S. is about the toughest,\u201d Lau said. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0the source of innovation in the Internet industry. You have your free SMS which takes away the cost appeal of microchat. You have iMessage \u2026\u00a0We will try to find ways to provide differentiated services.\u201d For now, Lau said, WeChat is seeing great traction in Southeast Asia.", "lede": "Tencent\u2019s market cap passed $100 billion a few weeks ago.

Circa debuted almost a year ago on Apple devices, and is structured around factoids called \u201catomic units of news.\u201d These units may be plucked from one story and dropped into another in lieu of traditional context paragraphs like, er , this one. Readers who \u201cfollow\u201d a story get notified of new facts as they\u2019re added to that story. That\u2019s all still true, but now Circa is getting more aggressive about having an earlier role in the breaking-news cycle. While the old app only sent push notifications for stories readers had elected to follow, the new app will also push out breaking stories, encouraging more frequent use of the app and following of topics, since the meat of each story will still be unfolding. According to a company press release, when readers open one of these notifications, they will see whatever information is new to them first, \u201cand the rest of the storyline below.\u201d That storyline is constructed by Circa\u2019s human editors, who place the factoids in descending order of importance, or the \u201cinverted pyramid\u201d in journalist-speak. CEO Matt Galligan said in an email interview that, according to numbers provided by Flurry, Circa users currently spend 50 percent longer in the app than they do in other news apps. Among users who open the app more than once in a day, he added, more than half return twice. Galligan declined to disclose download numbers. According to Onavo Insights , in the past two months, the Circa News app has ping-ponged between the 30s and the 130s in the download rankings for the News section of the U.S. App Store. The hope is that adding breaking-news alerts will bring the app\u2019s user retention up some more.

A new filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Wednesday shows Apple alleging that some \u201cHighly Confidential \u2014 Attorneys\u2019 Eyes Only\u201d licensing agreements it provided to Samsung\u2019s outside counsel were given to the Korean company\u2019s executives. Those agreements described the terms of an Apple-Nokia patent license and were not to be shared with anyone beyond Samsung\u2019s legal team. But, according to Apple, they were. The company alleges that they somehow found their way, unredacted, into the hands of dozens of Samsung executives, including Dr. Seungho Ahn, who leveraged them during licensing negotiations with Nokia. From the filing: According to a declaration from Nokia\u2019s Chief Intellectual Property Officer, Paul Melin, on June 4, 2013, in a meeting between Samsung and Nokia licensing executives, Dr. Seungho Ahn informed Nokia that the terms of the Apple-Nokia license were known to him. Specifically, according to Mr. Melin, Dr. Ahn stated that Apple had produced the Apple-Nokia license in its litigation with Samsung, and that Samsung\u2019s outside counsel had provided his team with the terms of the Apple-Nokia license. Mr. Melin recounts that to prove to Nokia that he knew the confidential terms of the Apple-Nokia license, Dr. Ahn recited the terms of the license, and even went so far as to tell Nokia that \u201call information leaks.\u201d Mr. Melin also reports that Dr. Ahn and Samsung then proceeded to use his knowledge of the terms of the Apple- Nokia license to gain an unfair advantage in their negotiations with Nokia, by asserting that the Apple-Nokia terms should dictate terms of a Samsung-Nokia license. Shady stuff, if it\u2019s true \u2014 and troubling. U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal has ordered Samsung to make Ahn available for deposition, and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Oct. 22.

All of them come equipped with 1.6GHz quad-core processors, high-resolution IPS displays, dual-band WiFi, 8GB built-in storage, Bluetooth and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. The 8-inch model has a 1024 x 768 pixel resolution, the 9.7-inch has 2048 x 1536 and the 10.1 model has 1280 x 800. The smallest of the lot also only has 1GB of DDR3 RAM while the other two have 2GB each. As a bonus incentive, the 10.1 model is the only one with GPS and a 2-megapixel camera on the front; the rest have a 0.3-megapixel front-facing cam. Other specs that are the same across the three are a microUSB port, a 3.5mm headset jack, a microSD card slot, a mini HDMI output and a 2-megapixel rear camera. As is often the case with Archos, the prices are very competitive: the 8-inch model will retail for $199.99, the 9.7-inch for $269.99 and the 10.1-inch model for $299.99.

Previewed in June 2013 (see BIMMERPOST preview video below) and intended for off-road use only, the BMW M Laptimer App records data from a BMW Apps\u2013equipped vehicle's on-board network and GPS receiver to create comparative track sessions and provide essential performance information. It generates track maps and captures essential driving data including top speed, number of laps, best lap time and ambient temperature. Information is then presented on the scorecard screen when the vehicle is no longer in motion. The BMW M Laptimer provides highly visual depictions of throttle, speed, brake input, engine RPM, fuel level, and g-force. Users can easily zoom in and out, and rewind or fast forward through track recordings. BMW M Laptimer will automatically calculate laps and times for the user without the need for pre-installed track map data. The App can be used on virtually any closed circuit. A Comparison Mode gives users the ability to view individual or dual runs in real-time. Users can select their own laps or compare against a lap sent by another BMW driver. Users may also share track day results with friends to compare data. Additionally, users can post results through social media integration, including Facebook and Twitter.", "lede": "BMW Launches the BMW M Laptimer App Precise, real-time racing-sty...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/bmw-m-laptimer-goes-live-in-ios-app-store/"}, {"author": "Timothy J.

With the IPO, Twitter is looking to raise $1 billion on 472,613,753 shares of common stock, trading under the stock symbol TWTR. In the filing, the company also confirmed that it now has 218.3 million monthly active users (or MAUs) according to its most recent numbers, and that it pulled in $253.6 million in revenue for the six months ending June 30th, 2013, an increase of 107 percent from a year earlier. According to the company, mobile users unsurprisingly account for a particularly big chunk of its business, with 75 percent of its average MAUs accessing Twitter from a mobile device in the three months ending June 30, 2013, and mobile use accounting for 65 percent of its advertising revenue. It still isn't making a profit, though, with the company seeing a net loss of $69.3 million for the aforementioned six month period. That's compared to $316.9 million in revenue for all of 2012, and a net loss of $79.4 million. Of those 215 million MAUs, 49.2 million are in the United States, while 169.1 million are international, representing an increase of 35% and 47%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Beyond those numbers, the company has also revealed the number of Timeline views for the first time; they stood at 150.9 billion for the three months ending June 30th, and 287.2 billion for six months prior (up 69% and 79% from a year earlier). On average, that translates to 691 timeline views per MAU for the same three month period, although that number jumps a fair bit looking just at US Twitter users -- they rack up 825 timeline views on average. In a brief letter to shareholders included in the filing, the company says \"Twitter represents a service shaped by the people, for the people,\" and that \"the mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers,\" adding, \"our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve\u2013and do not detract from\u2013a free and global conversation.\" Those interested in digging into all of the numbers can find the full filing on the SEC's website . &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;", "lede": "&#13; Less than a month after announcing its plans for an IPO, Tw...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/twitter-ipo-stock-public-offering-shares/"}, {"author": "Brian Heater", "title": "Peripheral Vision 006: Shawn Campbell on starting a radio station with a computer and microphone", "feed_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 20:18:00", "content": "&#13; \"People sometimes say, 'oh, you're just like a real radio station,' \" Shawn Campbell begins with a smile. \"I have to say, 'we are a real radio station -- we're just one that doesn't have a broadcast signal yet.' \" Campbell is seated besides a mic in studio B of what does, indeed, look like a real radio station. I might have half-jokingly made a comment along those lines when we arrived -- one-hundred-plus years of terrestrial broadcasting is enough to instill one with certain preconceived notions about what, precisely, makes a radio station. Campbell launched Chicago-based CHIRP in 2007 with terrestrial radio dreams and a team of 75 volunteers. \"I'd had a couple of bad experiences in radio where I'd really poured my heart and soul into a station, only to have it thwarted by the owners,\" she explains. \"Initially we thought that we were going to have to wait to apply for a low-power FM federal broadcast license. We thought we were going to have to lobby and change the laws to be able to do that. But we were so engaged that after about six months, we thought there [was] no reason not to start as an online station and continue our work to increase access for low-power FM and eventually apply for a license.\" &#13; Perceived dial congestion has made it all but impossible for potential low-power stations to secure themselves a spot on the airwaves in a city like Chicago. Through the great democratizing of the internet, however, the CHIRP team has been able to realize many of its community-organized radio ambitions. \"It's pretty cheap and it's really easy,\" Campbell says. \"You don't have to be super tech savvy to start.

Research and development costs \u2014 which \u201cconsist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services\u201d \u2014 came to nearly $112 million during the first half of 2013, or 44 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue during that period. Naturally, Twitter expects both of cost of revenue and R&amp;D costs to rise year over year, although they will vary as a percentage of the company\u2019s total revenue. By way of comparison, Facebook\u2019s cost of revenue for the year\u2019s first six months was $878 million and it spent $637 million on R&amp;D. It spent $595 million on infrastructure during that time period. Facebook also brought in more than $3.2 billion in revenue during that timeframe, so its costs were considerably less as a percentage of total revenue. If there\u2019s anything to take away from this comparison, it might be that no matter your business, being a mega web company means spending a lot of money on engineers who can build cutting-edge products and software to run them on. And Twitter\u2019s engineers are keeping plenty busy .\u00a0Perhaps because of the nature of its business (which is to say it doesn\u2019t store untold petabytes of photos ), Twitter is still able to lease data center space, although its costs to run them might go down in the long term if were it to build its own like Facebook has done.", "lede": "Twitter doesn\u2019t have nearly the scalability concerns of its web p...", "link": "http://gigaom.com/2013/10/03/twitter-is-spending-more-and-less-on-tech-than-you-might-think/"}, {"author": "Ki Mae Heussner", "title": "Want to see Google Glass at work in the hospital?

He just thinks his work is more useful \u2014 and he\u2019s going to share his code with anyone who wants to see it. Along with a team of Stanford researchers that includes machine learning expert and Coursera co-founder Andrew Ng , Socher has developed a computer model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a sentence 85 percent of the time.\u00a0The previous state of the art for this task \u2014 essentially, discerning whether the overall tone of a sentence is positive or negative \u2014 peaked at about 80 percent accuracy. In a field where improvements usually come fractions of a percent at a time, that 5 percent jump is a big deal. It\u2019s also a big deal to businesses, which are trying harder than ever to automate the task of figuring out what people are saying about them online . Almost every tweet, review, blog post or other piece of content expresses an opinion, but employing a human being to scan every one and instigate some sort of response or enter them into a database isn\u2019t exactly efficient. Early approaches to sentiment analysis or social media monitoring have been kind of crude, often focusing on individual words that don\u2019t account for context at all. @derrickharris Thanks for being a Quiznos fan, Derrick! Here\u2019s a coupon to use on your next visit: http://t.co/yWS2wDlhi6 \u2014 Quiznos (@Quiznos) February 27, 2013 Socher\u2019s team pulled off its accomplishment by focusing not just on single words, but on entire sentences. It took nearly 11,000 sentences from online movie reviews (from research database culled from Rotten Tomatoes, specifically) and created what the team has dubbed the Sentiment Treebank. What makes the Sentiment Treebank so novel is that the team split those nearly 11,000 sentences into more than 215,000 individual phrases and then used human workers \u2014 via Amazon Mechanical Turk \u2014 to classify each phrase on a scale from \u201cvery negative\u201d to \u201cvery positive.\u201d The team then built a new model it calls a Recursive Neural Tensor Network (it\u2019s an evolution of existing models called Recursive Neural Networks ), which is what actually processes all the words and phrases to create numeric representations for them and calculate how they interact with one another. When you\u2019re dealing with text like movie reviews that contain linguistic intricacies, Socher explained, you need a model that can really understand how words play off each other to alter the meaning of sentences. The order in which they come, and what connects them, matters a lot. A simple example of what Socher means would be a sentence like \u201cThere are slow and repetitive parts, but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting.\u201d \u201cUsually,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat comes after the \u2018but\u2019 dominates what comes before the \u2018but,\u2019\u201d and that\u2019s something a model focusing on single words or even single phrases might not be able to pick up. A visual representation of how Socher\u2019s model breaks down sentences. That sample sentence and the visual representation actually come from a website Socher\u2019s team built to show off and help train its model. The site includes a link to the research paper, as as well a live demonstration of the model on whatever sentences people enter, and a tool for exploring the Sentiment Treebank to see how it has classified sentences containing specific words. The code for the model will be available for download on the site in late October. Over time and with more sample sentences, Socher thinks his model could reach upward of 95 percent accuracy, but it will never be completely perfect. This is because there are always certain word combinations, sentence structures and jargon that don\u2019t appear enough to let the model effectively determine patterns in how they\u2019re used. The movie review training set, for example, didn\u2019t include many emoticons, so Socher\u2019s team is working on adding them to its system. It also had to develop algorithms to analyze the morphology of words. For example, Socher noted, the word \u201cabsurdly\u201d is used infrequently, but an algorithm is able to figure out that adding \u201cly\u201d to a word doesn\u2019t create a wholly new word with different sentiment. The new model and Sentiment Treebank by Socher and his team come as deep learning is catching on more broadly, thanks in part to research that companies such as Google , Facebook and Microsoft (Socher is actually a Microsoft Research Ph.D. fellow) have been publicizing in fields such as image recognition (or\u00a0computer vision), speech recognition and even language understanding. Earlier this week, IBM announced a research partnership with four high-profile universities that focuses in part on deep learning. Socher acknowledged the impressive work done elsewhere, but he\u2019s not convinced there\u2019s much commercial utility in focusing too much on image recognition (at least right now) or on single words. (Google and others would probably disagree, maybe quite strongly, and probably could probably raise some very good points.) So he and\u00a0his Stanford colleagues have been focusing on phrases and sentences, and aside from sentiment analysis, he says their models are pushing the state of the art in areas such as machine translation , grammatical analysis and logical reasoning. \u201cYou\u2019ll never care about translating a single word to another single word,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201dWe\u2019re actually able to put whole sentences and longer phrases into vector spaces without ignoring the order of the words.\u201d", "lede": "Stanford Ph.D. student Richard Socher appreciates the work Google...", "link": "http://gigaom.com/2013/10/03/stanford-researchers-to-open-source-model-they-say-has-nailed-sentiment-analysis/"}, {"author": "Kevin Fitchard", "title": "TextNow brings its all-IP mobile service to the Galaxy SIII and LTE", "feed_title": "GigaOM", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:38:56", "content": "TextNow became the first all-IP mobile operator in the country in August when it started selling a $19 plan and two Android phones that relied solely on Sprint\u2019s data networks to deliver voice and messaging services.

On Thursday it began selling the Samsung Galaxy SIII embedded with an LTE chip, giving it access to much faster data speeds a much better mobile VoIP experience.

In the three years that Dhir has joined Apple, he spearheaded efforts to push Apple products in the Indian market by boosting the network of Apple-exclusive stores, shortening the time span between the launch of new models overseas and in India, and expanded the Indian team threefold to more than 150 executives. Last year,\u00a0 Apple\u00a0turned to independent distributors \u00a0to sell its iPhone throughout the country, as the lack of\u00a0carrier subsidies limited adoption in India.\u00a0Apple has also reportedly been keen to\u00a0 push its iPhone in India \u00a0with more advertising as well as numerous discount schemes and monthly installment options. The company quietly launched the iPhone 5 in India in\u00a0 November last year . Next up for Apple in India: it wants to blaze its way into smaller cities and towns through its iPhones, iPads and iPods, as the population in these smaller markets is becoming richer and youths are aspiring toward Apple products. Apple is targeting 100 exclusive standalone stores under the franchisee model in these smaller Indian markets, and is seeking to roll them out this fiscal year, executives at a closed-door meeting hosting by Apple India told the Economic Times. India is a market with lots of potential According to figures from research firm Canalys in August, India managed to snag third place in worldwide smartphone shipments in Q2 2013, thanks to rapid growth of 129 percent to hit 9.0 million. It is little wonder that besides increasing its efforts to appeal to Chinese consumers, Apple also wants a slice of the pie in India. Apple CEO Tim Cook\u00a0said during a Q3 2013 earnings call in July that\u00a0iPhone sales in India during the quarter were up 400 percent year-on-year, while the\u00a0iPad posted double-digit unit growth in India in the same period. However, the increasing threat from low-cost manufacturers in these countries is a problem for Apple.\u00a0Canalys noted back in August that the only international vendor to really succeed in India was Samsung. Local vendors have been doing well in the price-conscious Indian market instead.\u00a0One of them is Micromax,\u00a0a handset manufacturer that has been\u00a0 threatening to tip Samsung off its leadership position \u00a0in the Indian smartphone market. Another one is\u00a0Karbonn, which was the third-ranked handset manufacturer in India during Q2 2013 according to IDC, with a market share of 13 percent.

Ars Technica made the discovery , and has a comprehensive account of the difference it made. In basic terms, this means Samsung has adjusted\u00a0the phone so that it recognizes benchmarking software and knows to run flat-out when it is being put through its paces. Benchmarking is commonly used by many tech media and analysts as a way to compare devices, showing which phones or tablets perform fastest across various categories and settings. Many critics are calling Samsung\u2019s actions cheating because the Note 3 does not run this fast in \u2018real world\u2019 conditions \u2014 it has battery-saving software and over-heating safeguards that kick in and prevent it from over-performing with any single app or activity. Their argument is that Samsung and others \u2014 for the company is not alone in benchmark optimizing \u2013\u00a0do this so that their devices score better in the tests, garners more impressive media coverage and are thus more attractive to those who are looking to buy a smartphone. But here\u2019s the thing, the storm being whipped up about this issue is totally overblown. User experience comes first Yes, Samsung is being deceitful to a point, but it\u2019s not like the scores are artificial or entirely fake, as they come from the device itself.\u00a0A more pertinent issue here is really how much emphasis is placed upon data, as people elevate the importance of benchmarking in particular I\u2019m not saying that benchmarking isn\u2019t a worthy pursuit, but its significance is too often overemphasized \u2014 perhaps by us technology geeks in the media, or those who like charts and statistical comparisons. The fact remains that a phone is about the user experience, and switching a few settings to generate \u201csmall gains in performance\u201d \u2014 to quote Anandtech \u2014 is really besides the issue. Support for apps, a fluid user experience, the potential to upgrade, price and plenty of other user-focused metrics are far more important and worthy of consideration when deciding on the quality of a phone \u2014 as TNW\u2019s own Nick Summers pointed out last week . To put it another way. Most people don\u2019t shop for a car based on its top speed, we look for things that will impact (or help) our daily lives. Yet you wouldn\u2019t criticize Toyota, Nissan, BMW and others for listing a car\u2019s top speed despite the fact that 99 percent of customers will never get to drive it that fast. The speed is pretty much irrelevant to the purchasing decision or any media review. The same logic should be applied to benchmarking. This is the domain of enthusiasts and statisticians, not everyday consumers. Everyone is \u2018cheating\u2019 Finally, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Samsung \u2014 which was found to have optimized the Galaxy S4 for benchmarking this summer \u2014 isn\u2019t alone in doing what it does. Anandtech notes that\u00a0\u2019cheating\u2019 is pretty much rife within the industry: With the exception of Apple and Motorola, literally every single OEM we\u2019ve worked with ships (or has shipped) at least one device that runs this silly CPU optimization. It\u2019s possible that older Motorola devices might\u2019ve done the same thing, but none of the newer devices we have on hand exhibited the behavior. It\u2019s a systemic problem that seems to have surfaced over the last two years, and one that extends far beyond Samsung. Were the issue to affect real-world testing, then it would be more serious. However, it\u2019s not clear how that would work,\u00a0and, in my opinion, that is a very different reality to wanting to showcase a device\u2019s optimal performance in benchmark testing, which is purely performance-oriented. For what it\u2019s worth, Samsung has denied \u00a0the accusations, claiming that \u201cthe\u00a0Galaxy Note 3 maximizes its CPU/GPU frequencies when running features that demand substantial performance.\u201d Images via\u00a0 vesna cvorovic \u00a0/ Shutterstock, Thinkstock", "lede": "Samsung is currently under fire for optimizing its newest devices...", "link": "http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2013/10/04/samsungs-benchmark-rigging-proves-we-need-a-better-way-to-judge-smartphone-performance/"}, {"author": "Jon Russell", "title": "Zynga founder Pincus says he was misquoted and is only bored of the \u2018current crop\u2019 of games", "feed_title": "The Next Web", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 06:19:30", "content": "Zynga founder Mark Pincus has responded to suggestions that he is fed up \u00a0with the gaming industry by claiming he has been misquoted and taken out of context.

(The company has since appealed the ruling.) Kaleidescape makes home theater machines\u2014devices that can keep all of your DVD and Blu-ray\u00a0movies in a single location and play them without the hassle of digging through DVD cases to find the right disc. The thing that sticks out about Kaleidescape is that its home theater boxes aren't small. These are typically enormous devices that cost many thousands of dollars, and the boxes are more likely to be installed by a home theater contractor than by a normal consumer. Any self-respecting home theater geek these days likely already has a setup designed to do something similar. This usually takes the form of a home theater PC running XBMC or one of its variants , with video and music stored either on internal storage or connected to a NAS over Ethernet. Doing this will get you a system that does most of the things Kaleidescape's boxes do, but the DIY route comes with the added hassle of installing and maintaining your own software. You also need to acquire a working knowledge of disc ripping and encoding, a task that isn't terribly difficult \u00a0but isn't terribly easy\u00a0 either. Kaleidescape's systems automate a significant chunk of the HTPC experience, wrapping the movie ripping and storage aspect in a single attractive package that looks and functions more like an appliance than an HTPC. The company's traditional products, as mentioned, are expensive \u2014like, $10,000-type expensive. They're great for an upmarket customer who wants to wire every room in his or her vacation home up for movie watching, but it's not a great option for the more middle-class among us. The Cinema One is Kaleidescape's attempt at moving a bit down the market. The system still isn't anywhere near approaching \"cheap,\" but it is significantly less expensive than previous Kaleidescape offerings. A Cinema One will set you back about $3,000. Expense is relative, but that's still a heart-stopping chunk of change. For that amount of money, though, you get an awesome home theater system that stores hundreds of movies and can access hundreds more online. It's a great little box, but is it worth it? That depends. Let's dive in. Unboxing and physicality The Cinema One arrived tucked away neatly inside its box, along with an accessory kit containing a very normal-looking infrared remote control with batteries, a power brick and cord, an Ethernet cable, an HDMI cable, and a tiny USB 802.11n Wi-Fi adapter. It's gratifying to see the cables and the Wi-Fi adapter already included. Considering the device's price, their absence would be inexcusable. Lee Hutchinson The Kaleidescape Cinema One's box, unopened. Lee Hutchinson The Kaleidescape Cinema One's box, unopened. Lee Hutchinson The box includes a big quick-start guide with lots of movies on it. Lee Hutchinson The Quick Start guide is quite helpful and includes info on setting up the Cinema One's remote to control your TV and other AV gear. Lee Hutchinson The accessory box contains a remote control with batteries; cables for power, Ethernet, and HDMI; and an 802.11n Wi-Fi USB dongle. There's a large fold-out poster stuck atop the accessory kit showing how to get the system up and running quickly. This includes details on how to program the remote to control your television, receiver, and other things in your A/V stack. The system is designed to look exactly like a DVD or Blu-ray\u00a0player. Its dimensions mirror those of a typical player, and it has a pleasant clutter-free white plastic bezel with a disc slot, a light-up logo (which dims during movie playback), and a trio of buttons. Those buttons allow you to eject a disc, rip the disc's contents to your library, and power the system on and off. The system's casing is metal and quite sturdy; the entire thing weighs about 10 lbs (4.6 kg). The port layout on the back of the unit is as pleasingly sparse as its front bezel\u2014from left to right, there's a power plug, an HDMI port, analog audio output ports, a digital audio coax output port, a USB port (for the Wi-Fi dongle), a gigabit Ethernet port, and a small plug for connecting an additional infrared receiver.

The Indonesian government and Freeport blamed the killings on a separatist group, the Free Papua Movement, which had been fighting a low-level guerrilla war for several decades. I opened my article with this sentence: \"Bush Administration officials have determined that Indonesian soldiers carried out a deadly ambush that killed two American teachers.\" I also reported that two FBI agents had travelled to Indonesia to assist in the inquiry and quoted a \"senior administration official\" as saying there \"was no question there was a military involvement.'' The story prompted a leak investigation. The FBI sought to obtain my phone records and those of Jane Perlez, the Times bureau chief in Indonesia and my wife. They also went after the records of the Washington Post reporters in Indonesia who had published the first reports about the Indonesian government's involvement in the killings. As part of its investigation, the FBI asked for help from what is described in a subsequent government report as an \"on-site communications service\" provider. The report, by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, offers only the vaguest description of this key player, calling it \"Company A.'' \"We do not identify the specific companies because the identities of the specific providers who were under contract with the FBI for specific services are classified,'' the report explained. Whoever they were, Company A had some impressive powers. Through some means\u2014the report is silent on how\u2014Company A obtained records of calls made on Indonesian cell phones and landlines by the Times and Post reporters. The records showed whom we called, when, and for how long\u2014what has now become famous as \" metadata .\" Under DOJ rules, the FBI investigators were required to ask the attorney general to approve a grand jury subpoena before requesting records of reporters' calls. But that's not what happened. Instead, the bureau sent Company A what is known as an \" exigent letter '' asking for the metadata. A heavily redacted version of the DOJ report , released in 2010, noted that exigent letters are supposed to be used in extreme circumstances where there is no time to ask a judge to issue a subpoena. The report found nothing \"exigent'' in an investigation of several three-year-old newspaper stories. The need for an exigent letter suggests two things about Company A. First, that it was an American firm subject to American laws. Second, that it had come to possess my records through lawful means and needed legal justification to turn them over to the government. The report disclosed that the agents' use of the exigent letter was choreographed by the company and the bureau. It said the FBI agent drafting the letter received \"guidance\" from \"a Company A analyst.'' According to the report, lawyers for Company A and the bureau worked together to develop the approach. Not surprisingly, \"Company A\" quickly responded to the letter it helped write. In fact, it was particularly generous, supplying the FBI with records covering a 22-month period, even though the bureau's investigation was limited to a seven-month period. Altogether, \"Company A\" gave the FBI metadata on 1,627 calls by me and the other reporters. Only three calls were within the seven-month window of phone conversations investigators had decided to review. It doesn't end there. The DOJ\u00a0report asserts that \"the FBI made no investigative use of the reporters' telephone records.\" But I don't believe that is accurate. In 2007, I heard rumblings that the leak investigation was focusing on a diplomat named Steve Mull, who was the deputy chief of mission in Indonesia at the time of the killings. I had known Mull when he was a political officer in Poland and I was posted there in the early 1990s. He is a person of great integrity and a dedicated public servant. The DOJ\u00a0asked to interview me. Of course, I would not agree to help law enforcement officials identify my anonymous sources. But I was troubled because I felt an honorable public servant had been forced to spend money on lawyers to fend off a charge that was untrue. After considerable internal debate, I decided to talk to the DOJ\u00a0for the limited purpose of clearing Mull. It was not a decision I could make unilaterally. The Times also had a stake in this. If I allowed myself to be interviewed, how could the Times say no the next time the government wanted to question a Times reporter about a leak? The Times lawyer handling this was George Freeman, a journalist's lawyer, a man Times reporters liked having in their corner. George and the DOJ\u00a0lawyers began to negotiate over my interview. Eventually, we agreed that I would speak on two conditions: one, that they could not ask me for the name of my source; and two, if they asked me if it was \u2018X,' and I said no, they could not then start going through other names. Freeman and I sat across a table from two DOJ\u00a0lawyers. I'm a lawyer, and I prided myself on being able to answer their questions with ease, never having to turn to Freeman for advice. Until that is, one of the lawyers took a sheaf of papers that was just off to his right and began asking me about phone calls I made to Mull. One call was for 19 minutes, the DOJ\u00a0lawyer said, giving me the date and time. I asked for a break to consult with Freeman. We came back and answered questions about the phone calls. I said that I couldn't remember what these calls were about\u2014it had been more than four years earlier\u2014but that Mull had not given me any information about the killings. Per our agreement, the DOJ\u00a0lawyers did not ask further questions about my sources, and the interview ended. I didn't know how the DOJ\u00a0had gotten my phone records, but I assumed the Indonesian government had provided them. Then, about a year later, I received a letter from the FBI's general counsel, Valerie Caproni who wrote that my phone records had been taken from \"certain databases\" under the authority of an \"exigent letter,'' (a term I had never heard). Caproni sent similar letters to Perlez, to the Washington Post reporters, and to the executive editors of the Post and the Times, Leonard Downie and Bill Keller, respectively. In addition, FBI Director Robert Mueller called Downie and Keller, according to the report. Caproni wrote that the records had not been seen by anyone other than the agent requesting them and that they had been expunged from all databases. I'm uneasy because the DOJ\u00a0report makes clear that the FBI is still concealing some aspect of this incident. After describing Caproni's letters, the report says, \"However, the FBI did not disclose to the reporters or their editors that [BLACKED OUT].\" The thick black lines obliterate what appear to be several sentences. If you were to ask senior intelligence officials whether I should wonder about those deletions, they'd probably say no. I'm not so sure. The government learned extensive details about my personal and professional life. Most of those calls were about other stories I was writing. Some were undoubtedly to arrange my golf game with the Australian ambassador. Is he now under suspicion? The report says the data has been destroyed and that only two analysts ever looked at it. But who is this 'Company A\" that willingly cooperated with the government? Why was it working hand in glove with the FBI? And what did the FBI director not tell the editors of the Times and the Washington Post when he called them acknowledging that the government had improperly obtained reporter's records?

Still, it seems much more realistic when you see the fully navigable, 3D virtual reality version of Mars that Norris and other JPL researchers have already created using funding from NASA's Game Changing Development program and some technology originally designed for more realistic gaming. While it's pretty awe-inspiring to be able to look at the surface of another world through panoramic photos or IMAX movies , a flat image is not exactly the best way to study the surface of another planet. \"If you're looking at a panoramic image on a flat monitor... you might think that something's to your right that's actually behind you, because you're looking at a rolled out picture,\" Norris pointed out. \"Or you might zoom in on something and think 'Oh, that's significantly to the right of me.' But because you're zoomed in so far, it might just be a couple of degrees to your right, because you don't have the reference points on Mars.\" That's part of why JPL has been looking into ways to let researchers and members of the public experience the data it's getting from Mars more naturally. In the past, the team has looked into room-sized \"surround theaters\" that project images from the Martian surface on the floors, walls, and ceilings, ensconcing users in a Martian environment. These installations are comfortable, but also quite expensive. They also require users to make a special trip to use them. For a more portable home or office-based simulation, the team turned to gaming technologies to make navigating more intuitive and effective. \"We're always watching the market for new devices that are potentially useful for work,\" Norris said. \"We like working with video game technologies because they're designed to be very accessible for people. They also tend to be very low cost.\" Norris seems particularly excited about the team's current research, which combines an HD prototype of the Oculus Rift head-mounted display with Vicon's Bonita position tracking system . Users can actually walk and look around a simulation of the Martian surface, as shown in a video the team released today. The people behind the Oculus are excited as well. \u201cVirtual reality is immediately useful as a way to get people excited about space again, and as the hardware advances, it will become a powerful tool for real research and exploration,\" Oculus CEO Palmer Luckey told Ars. \"In particular, virtual reality based telepresence\u00a0could allow human operators to perform tasks in hostile environments without actually going there themselves. For many use scenarios, the dexterity and locomotion capabilities of a human piloted robot will surpass what a real person in a spacesuit can do. JPL has some amazing stuff in the pipeline that is going to have a big impact on mankind. It makes me very happy to see people using virtual reality and the Rift for the greater good.\" Virtual Mars JPL's simulation of the Martian surface is put together by taking a panoramic parallax image sent by a Martian rover and stitching it together onto the surface of a virtual cylinder about 50 square meters (164 square feet) in base area. Researchers then superimpose 3D point cloud data gathered by the rover on top of the scene, creating a series of meshes called \"surflets\" that give the impression of depth. The result, as you see in the video, is a fully explorable, accurate 3D slice of the Martian surface sent to Earth from hundreds of thousands of miles away. \"When you consider all of the data that Curiosity has acquired, plus Opportunity and Spirit, we have hundreds of these sites,\" JPL Human Interfaces Software Engineer Victor Luo told Ars. Being inside a 3D virtual Mars is undoubtedly cool, but it also has important applications as a research tool, Norris said. Using the Oculus Rift, researchers can study the data sent by Curiosity just as they would view the world around them\u2014by moving their heads and walking around. Norris said that using these natural human abilities to engage with different environments is key to making them more effective explorers in a strange world. \"Think about how amazing of an ability every human has to extract vast amount of information from the environment just by being present in it,\" Norris said. \"Then you consider that geologists and other scientists build on those abilities with specialized training and field work and things like that. But then we ask them to go and explore the planet by peering at flat images on ordinary computer monitors and so on. We have some evidence that this makes our natural abilities work against us rather than for us. This project is about correcting that.\" Adding the Vicon motion tracker to the setup gives researchers another ability they don't easily have with flat pictures of the Martian surface: the ability to walk around and examine bits that interest them up close. \"If you're looking at pictures taken by the robot, you're kind of frozen where the robot is,\" Norris said. \"We want people to be able to get up and move around in that space.\" More than just locomotion, though, Norris said the motion tracker adds verisimilitude via the \"little motions\" humans make when looking around, such as shifting a shoulder or leaning the neck to one side. This kind of parallax motion is a key way that humans and other animals assess depth and distance in their environment, and it allows for a much more accurate impression of the user's virtual Martian surroundings. Enlarge / This might not look that impressive on your flat computer screen, but just wait until you can experience it on an HD head-mounted display. This is all useful for researchers on the ground trying to form scientific hypotheses about the Martian landscape, of course. But Norris sees this kind of technology being used by the operators navigating Martian rovers, letting them \"be more informed and better aware of the environment of the robot, what we call the morphology of the environment\u2014what's it shaped like, where are the rocks, what orientation are they, how are they arranged. When you're driving a robot around on another planet, it's important to know what the environment right around it is...\" he said. The future As impressive as the working prototype JPL has up and running is, it's very much a first draft of the kind of virtual reality environments the lab hopes to create. In the future, JPL researchers are looking to integrate other data to make the virtual Martian environment more detailed, including data from lower-resolution orbital photos and true-color rover \"Mastcams\" that generate much higher spatial resolution when zoomed in. The model may even eventually integrate data from wide-field, close-mounted \"hazard cameras\" that were designed to monitor the area immediately surrounding the rovers' treads and robotic arm for safety. Researchers are also looking to increase immersion by adding Martian audio to the simulation, despite a lack of direct sound measurement on the planet itself. \"We don't have a microphone on Mars, so we don't know exactly what it sounds like, but we can model it,\" Norris said. \"Curiosity has a weather station. We know how hard the wind is blowing, we know the atmospheric pressure, we could render the audio in a very convincing way... It should sound like a high whistling.\" As for the user interface, the researchers are looking into adding some kind of accurate hand-tracking to let users reach out and interact with the virtual Martian soil. \"The interaction language inside of a virtual reality environment is kind of non-defined,\" Luo said. \"Using a joystick really doesn't make that much sense when you're on Mars. How would you navigate in that environment? ... Is there some other kind of hardware that could be attached or installed to help with that?\" Norris said the JPL team has experimented with hand-tracking solutions ranging from the LeapMotion and Kinect to the Razer Hydra and accelerometer-based gloves, but no option has really provided the perfect combination of accurate tracking, mobility, and light encumbrance on the hands. Still, he's hopeful that the game industry might help him out on this score in the near future. \"One of the things we love about working in this area is that there are a lot of companies that are attacking these problems for a lot of reasons\u2014video games, entertainment\u2014but we'll benefit as well,\" he said. While JPL is still long way off from releasing its virtual Mars in a way that the public can enjoy, Norris said that \"making it possible for the public to join us on the surface of these distant worlds in a way that feels much more real than looking at a picture on a screen we think is of great importance and really exciting.\" And there's always that eventual goal of letting the world experience the first steps on Martian soil in a holodeck-like environment, of course. \"I think those kinds of events, those kinds of explorations in the future, need to be experienced by our whole civilization, and these technologies are how we can make that happen,\" Norris said. \"It's how we can be a part of that in a way that's so much more real than anything that's ever been available to us before.\"", "lede": "He's not really on Mars... but in a way, he kind of is. \"My dream...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/10/how-gaming-tech-is-making-for-better-interplanetary-exploration/"}, {"author": "Joe Mullin", "title": "Key Senator wants to ban bulk surveillance, leading to Democratic showdown", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:45:10", "content": "NSA leaks View all\u2026 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) expressed support yesterday for serious surveillance reform, saying he will introduce legislation that calls for an end to the National Security Agency's (NSA) mass dragnet of phone data.

However, Leahy\u2014the chairman of the judiciary committee\u2014is clearly in a powerful position from which to move such a bill forward. In the Senate, it's going to be a serious Democrat-on-Democrat battle, since the chairman of the Senate's top intelligence committee, Diane Feinstein (D-CA), has made it clear she will fight such a bill. At a hearing yesterday, Feinstein said the bulk data collection could prevent another event like the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \u201cI will do everything I can to prevent this program from being canceled out\u2026to destroy it is to make this nation more vulnerable,\" said Feinstein,\u00a0according to a Politico\u00a0 report \u00a0on the hearing. The justification for bulk data collection was \"strained at best,\" said Leahy. He doesn't believe the position of the intelligence community that the bulk data program stopped 54 terrorist plots, citing \"inaccurate\" reports from the Obama Administration. \"That\u2019s plainly wrong. These weren\u2019t all plots, and they weren\u2019t all thwarted,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because something is technologically possible, and just because something may be deemed technically legal, does not mean that it is the right thing to do,\" Leahy added. It isn't clear how many senators on the committee would support Leahy's position. Support could come from conservative Republicans on the committee like Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), but neither voiced their positions yesterday, according to Politico. Democrats called for reform but were more focused on smaller measures, like adding an advocate to the FISC. Leahy is working together with politicians pushing an identical bill in the House, where the idea of banning bulk data collection is drawing important supporters like the Republican head of House Judiciary oversight, Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). (Sensenbrenner co-authored the PATRIOT Act). According to Politico, the ranking Democratic member of House Judiciary John Conyers (D-MI) is also a supporter.

NSA leaks View all\u2026 Three United Kingdom-based nonprofit organizations and a German Internet activist have filed a lawsuit against the British government at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), arguing that the UK's electronic spying network is illegal. Documents provided by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden have shown that the UK\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the sister organization to the NSA, has been one of the most prominent players in digital surveillance, particularly of European traffic. The lawsuit was filed Thursday at the ECHR in Strasbourg, France by Big Brother Watch, Open Rights Group, English PEN, and Constanze Kurz , who has been a longtime spokesperson for the Chaos Computer Club, a well-known German hacker group. \u201cBeyond effective legal scrutiny\u201d In the 67-page filing, the appellants argue that the communications interception is in direct violation of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights , Europe\u2019s rough analog to the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Unlike the Fourth Amendment, however,\u00a0 Article 8 specifically carves out a national security exception. It states: Article 8 \u2013 Right to respect for private and family life 1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. In their filing , the appellants argue that because the newly revealed data collection is \u201cindiscriminate,\u201d it cannot possibly be \u201csubject to any sufficiently precise or ascertainable legal framework and is beyond effective legal scrutiny.\u201d More precisely: In effect, the power to obtain and use external communications data by means of intercept is unfettered in published law, as long as it is thought broadly to be in the interests of [national] security or other of the specified generic purpose. There are no adequate criteria by which a court of tribunal could assess the legality of use of any particular intercept material even if the courts had jurisdiction to do so, which they do not. Holding the powerful accountable Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said in a statement that British laws have been interpreted far more broadly than how they originally were intended. \u201cThe laws governing how Internet data is accessed were written when barely anyone had broadband access and were intended to cover old-fashioned copper telephone lines,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament did not envisage or intend those laws to permit scooping up details of every communication we send, including content, so it\u2019s absolutely right that GCHQ is held accountable in the courts for its actions.\u201d The court, which is composed of 47 judges from each of the member states of the Council of Europe, may take months (or years) to render a decision. However, this case likely will be heard by a smaller committee composed of three or seven judges. The ECHR\u2019s own flow chart shows a long process (PDF) that likely awaits this application, along with the 50,000 other new applications that it receives each year. \u201cThe timetable is for the court, but I would hope for the case to be formally communicated to the UK within a couple of months,\u201d Daniel Carey, the chief solicitor in the case, told Ars. \u201cThereafter, they are likely to have two to three months for their response before the court considers next steps.

Texas Instruments said that with the TRE's 1GHz processor, it is the \"most powerful Arduino to date\" and the first that will be able to run \"full Linux.\" It will be available in spring 2014 from arduino.cc and other distributors, with pricing not yet announced. \"For the first time ever, Arduino users can use the full capabilities of Linux and gain access to a variety of new on-board connectivity options to develop a range of powerful, advanced applications while leveraging the simplicity of the Arduino software experience,\" the Texas Instruments announcement said. \"The Sitara-processor-powered Arduino TRE serves as a network hub that can connect to millions of classic Arduino nodes, enabling customers to be at the forefront of the Internet-of-Things era.\" This also removes the requirement for Arduino to be programmed with a separate PC. \"Arduino users no longer need a PC, but can access the full capabilities of Linux as well as a variety of connectivity options, including Ethernet, XBee wireless radios, USB and CAN,\" Texas Instruments said. \"As a result, users can implement more advanced applications with high-resolution LCD displays, hardware-accelerated 3D graphics and increased connectivity. The AM335x processor also includes two on-chip 200 MHz 32-bit Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) microcontrollers, which can be used for innumerable real-time applications including motor control and pulse width modulation.\" Arduino released its own announcement, saying the TRE will provide \"up to 100 times more performance\" than the Arduino Leonardo or Uno . \"This performance opens the doors to more advanced Linux-powered applications. The Sitara-processor-based Linux Arduino can run high-performance desktop applications, processing-intensive algorithms, or high-speed communications,\" Arduino said. The announcement did not provide a direct comparison to the Arduino Due , which is a year old and was the first ARM-based Arduino with an ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. Arduino also did not compare the TRE's performance to the new Arduino Galileo, which has a 400MHz Intel Quark processor, or say whether Galileo will be able to run Linux as well. We've asked Arduino for further details. ( UPDATE : Intel has answered this question, saying in an FAQ , \"Intel Galileo runs Linux out of the box. It comes in two flavors; the default is a small Linux. If you add an SD card to your kit, you can add a more fully-featured Linux.\" Thanks to commenter MrPippy for pointing this out. ) The TRE is actually \"two Arduinos in one,\" the \"Sitara-processor-based Linux Arduino, plus a full AVR-based (Atmel microcontroller) Arduino, while leveraging the simplicity of the Arduino software experience,\" Arduino's announcement said. \"The integration of the AVR Arduino enables the Arduino TRE to use the existing shield ecosystem so that innovators can expand the Arduino TRE to develop a wide range of high-performance applications such as 3D printers, gateways for building automation and lighting automation, telemetry hubs that collect data from nearby sensors wirelessly, and other connected applications that require host control plus real-time operations.\" Arduino designed the TRE in partnership with one of its ostensible rivals, the BeagleBoard.org foundation . The TRE is also the first Arduino board manufactured in the US. Previous Arduinos were made in Italy. Despite now using both Intel and ARM processors, Arduino isn't giving up on the Atmel microcontrollers that have historically powered its products. Arduino said it is working with Atmel on future products.", "lede": "The Arduino TRE.

Photograph by Kyle Orland Today's high-definition game consoles can be big power drainers, drawing around 70 to 100 Watts when in active use (depending on the model). That's down from over 170W of energy draw when the systems were first launched, thanks to firmware updates and hardware redesigns. Still, it can be quite a lot of energy, especially when the systems are being used for relatively simple things like Netflix streaming (an Apple TV, for comparison, only uses about 6W of power, and a Super Nintendo uses only 10W). The energy situation seems poised to improve with the next generation of consoles, though, according to a Polygon report . Systems like the Xbox One were \"designed from the ground up to maximize computational power per watt,\" according to Microsoft Senior Compliance Manager Tim Calland. The Xbox One's scalable multicore design is key to that efficiency, he said. \"One major difference we have now versus the Xbox 360 is scalable architecture, which means that it deals with tasks by just using the amount of computing capacity needed for the work to be done. Gaming is the big high-power experience, but when we are doing lesser functionality like streaming media, we're using much less energy than the Xbox 360 did when we launched... We have eight cores now and we only use the amount that we need. That wasn't an option in the last generation.\" Even when running at full capacity, Calland said that the Xbox One generates \"eight times the computational power for the same amount of energy as Xbox 360 at launch.\" Of course, the Xbox One has a much higher ceiling for computational power than the Xbox 360 did, so the overall energy consumption for players upgrading is still likely to see a bump. Still, there's room for that efficiency to improve over the console's lifetime, just as it did with the current generation of consoles. Calland also confirmed that the Xbox One will be set to shut down after 60 minutes of idle time by default, just like the Wii U. Even though that setting can be overridden by users, turning it on by default can have a surprisingly large effect on a console's aggregate lifetime power consumption.", "lede": "The mess of cables and power bricks required to power my home ent...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/multicore-design-makes-next-generation-consoles-more-energy-efficient/"}, {"author": "Ars Staff", "title": "How the feds took down the Dread Pirate Roberts", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 05:00:25", "content": "If you've been living under a cultural rock the Dread Pirate Roberts was a character from the cult film The Princess Bride (based upon the book of the same name). Aurich Lawson / ACT III Communications The Silk Road bust View all\u2026 The Dread Pirate Roberts, head of the most brazen drug trafficking site in the world, was a walking contradiction. Though the government says he raked in $80 million in commissions from running Silk Road, he allegedly lived under a false name in one bedroom of a San Francisco home that he shared with two other guys and for which he paid $1,000 a month in cash. Though his alleged alter ego penned manifestos about ending \"violence, coercion, and all forms of force,\" the FBI claims that he tried to arrange a hit on someone who had blackmailed him. And though he ran a site widely assumed to be under investigation by some of the most powerful agencies in the US government, the Dread Pirate Robert appears to have been remarkably sloppy \u2014so sloppy that the government finally put a name to the peg leg: Ross William Ulbricht. Yesterday, Ulbricht left his apartment to visit the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco Public Library in the southern part of the city. Library staff did not recognize him as a regular library patron, but they thought nothing of his visit as he set up his laptop in the science fiction section of the stacks. Then, at 3:15pm, staffers heard a \"crashing sound\" from the sci-fi collection and went to investigate, worried that a patron had fallen. Instead, library Communications Director Michelle Jeffers tells us that the staff came upon \"six to eight\" FBI agents arresting Ulbricht and seizing his laptop. The agents had tailed him, waiting for the 29-year-old to open his computer and enter his passwords before swooping in. They marched him out of the library without incident. For a promising young physics student from Austin, Texas, this wasn't how things were supposed to turn out. Ulbricht, in happier times. \u201cChoose freedom over tyranny\u201d Sure, you could buy meth, LSD, cannabis, heroin, and MDMA on the Silk Road, but the hidden website wasn't (just) about drugs. Silk Road was, said its owner, about freedom. In January 2012, as part of a \"State of the Road Address\" posted in the site's discussion forum, the Dread Pirate Roberts explained the site's goal: \"To grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.\" To that end, the Dread Pirate Roberts built the Silk Road marketplace in 2011 as a \"hidden\" service accessible only over the encrypted Tor network. To connect, users first had to install a Tor client and then visit a series of arcane site names (the most recent was silkroadfb5piz3r.onion), but the reward was a simple, effective marketplace to buy drugs from sellers all over the world using such Internet commerce staples as escrow accounts and buyer feedback. The product was shipped through the mail, direct from seller to buyer, keeping the Dread Pirate Roberts clean. The only link between him and the drugs was the money, and Roberts eventually took only the electronic currency called Bitcoin to make this hard to trace. He even ran a program called a \"tumbler\" to route incoming Bitcoin payments through a complicated series of dummy transactions, so as to make them infeasible to trace through the public Bitcoin blockchain. Out of each transaction, Roberts took a cut\u20148 to 15 percent, depending on the size of the sale. This eventually earned Roberts a pirate's treasure. By 2013, Silk Road had nearly one million user accounts. In the 2.5 years the site operated, it facilitated 1.2 million transactions worth 9.5 million Bitcoins\u2014or about $1.2 billion in total money exchanged. (Bitcoin values varied widely over this period.) Roberts picked up a cool $80 million in commissions. No surprise, then, that the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and the FBI all joined forces to track down Roberts and the largest sellers on his marketplace. In November 2011, after coming under pressure from Congress, the agencies began the hunt and quickly found that Roberts had been right\u2014encryption, Tor, and \"tumbled\" Bitcoins were a potent combination to crack. Ulbricht at his 21st birthday party. But investigations always have many threads to pull. The feds couldn't initially follow the money to Roberts, nor could they find the physical location of his cloaked servers. In the absence of usual digital clues, the feds fell back on a low-tech approach: keep going back in time until you find the first guy to ever talk about the Silk Road. Find that guy and you probably have a person of interest, if not Roberts himself. So they looked, assigning one agent to conduct \"an extensive search of the Internet,\" in the FBI's words, looking for early Silk Road publicity. The earliest post ever to mention the site appeared on a drug-oriented forum called shroomery.org, where a user named \"altoid\" had made a single post . It read: I came across this website called Silk Road. It's a Tor hidden service that claims to allow you to buy and sell anything online anonymously. I'm thinking of buying off it, but wanted to see if anyone here had heard of it and could recommend it. The post directed readers to visit silkroad420.wordpress.com, belonging to the blogging operator WordPress, where further instructions would be found for accessing the real Silk Road site. A subpoena to WordPress Revealed that the blog had been set up on January 23, only four days before the Altoid post. If this wasn't the first mention of Silk Road, it was certainly one of them. Altoid became a person of interest, but who was he? Further research revealed that Altoid had been posting on a board called Bitcoin Talk\u2014further suggesting a possible link to the Silk Road, which operated on Bitcoin. A key break came when the agent found an October 11, 2011 post by Altoid, looking for an \"IT pro in the Bitcoin community\" and directing all inquiries to \"rossulbricht at gmail dot com.\" A subpoena to Google revealed that this account was in fact registered to one \"Ross Ulbricht.\" The account was also linked to a Google+ profile, which had a picture of Ulbricht and a link to his favorite videos on YouTube . The videos provided a key clue; several of them were from the libertarian Mises Institute, whose views jibed with the leanings of the Dread Pirate Roberts. In addition, Roberts had repeatedly linked up Mises videos when posting in the Silk Road forum and had referenced \"Austrian school\" economists like Ludwig von Mises, for whom the Institute was named. The clue was suggestive but not conclusive. Still, the pieces were coming together. The economic simulator Enlarge / Ulbricht and his horseshoe mustache. With the name Ross Ulbricht, the feds went to other social networks. They found Ulbricht on LinkedIn, where he talked about his dissatisfaction with the physics work he had been doing as a graduate student at Penn State. \"Now, my goals have shifted,\" Ulbricht wrote. \"I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind... The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.\" Could the \"economic simulation\" be, in fact, Silk Road? One tantalizing hint comes from an anonymous article published in alternative newspaper The Austin Cut , located in Austin, Texas where Ulbricht grew up. The story was, in essence, a primer on how to build Silk Road and an explanation of what made the site so amazing\u2014and the answers were \"freedom\" and \"lack of force.\" \"Hackers, anarchists, and criminals have been dreaming about these days since forever,\" wrote the author. \"Where you can turn on your computer, browse the web anonymously, make an untraceable cash-like transaction, and have a product in your hands, regardless of what any government or authority decides... This is about real freedom. Freedom from violence, from arbitrary morals and law, from corrupt centralized authorities, and from centralization altogether. While Silk Road and Bitcoin may fade or be crushed by their enemies, we've seen what free, leaderless systems can do. You can only chop off so many heads.\" The article's author then relayed a telling anecdote from Silk Road, one in which people began arguing over a botched deal. They got angry; one threatened violence, but he was simply mocked by other users because he had no way to find his target. \"It showed how successful Silk Road really is,\" wrote the author. \"It makes drug buying and selling so smooth that it's easy to forget what kinds of violent fuckers drug dealers can be. That's the whole point of Silk Road. It totally takes evil pieces of shit out of the drug equation. Whether they're vicious drug dealers or bloodthirsty narcotics cops, both sides of that coin suck and end pretty much the same way. Death, despair, madness, prison, etc. Thanks to decentralization and powerful encryption, we're able to operate in a digital world that is almost free from prohibition and the violence it causes.\" This fits with Ulbricht's arguments, and the piece might well be by him, providing a better sense of why he saw the experiment as such an important one. We asked the editor of the Cut what he thought. \"I wondered the same thing,\" he said, but he added that he didn't know who wrote the piece. In any event, the feds had a name but no hard evidence linking Ulbricht to the site management. They knew that Ulbricht had moved to San Francisco and was staying for some time with a friend, and they knew that whoever was logging into the \"rossulbricht\" Gmail account was doing it on occasion from the friend's house. But the next link in the chain only came when the feds uncovered a post on the popular coding advice site StackOverflow. In early 2012, Ulbricht registered a StackOverflow account using his Gmail address; the username was \"Ross Ulbricht.\" On March 16, Ulbricht asked for help with connecting \"to a Tor hidden server using curl in php.\" He included several lines of code that weren't working quite right. Perhaps realizing that this was a bad idea, one minute later Ulbricht changed his username to \"frosty\" (he changed his e-mail address a bit later), but he had already revealed his interest in running Tor sites. At this point, the government gets cryptic. On July 10, 2013, Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package coming from Canada into the US as part of a \"routine border search.\" This package contained nine counterfeit IDs, each of them in a different name, but each of them showing a picture of Ulbricht. They were addressed to his San Francisco address. Two weeks later, the government found the Silk Road servers in various foreign countries, though it won't say how. (The FBI gives no indication that Tor was compromised in this case, though given that the agency has recently found ways to spy on Tor users, it's hard to absolutely rule out the possibility.)\u00a0It's possible that finding various aliases for Ulbricht enabled agents to track the money used to pay for the servers, but the events may have been unrelated. The main Silk Road Web server was found in \"a certain foreign country\" that has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US. Under the terms of that treaty, the government asked for an image of the server's hard drives, which was made on July 23 and then turned over to the FBI. ( Update : Computer security research Nicholas Weaver speculates that \"the FBI (with a warrant) hacked the site sufficient to discover the site's IP by generating a non-Tor phone-home and then contacted the country of the hosting provider which then got the server imaged. Yet since the server imaging didn't involve taking the server down or disrupting service sufficient to spook Mr DPR into taking his bitcoins and running, I suspect that this was some virtual-machine hosting provider.\" But at this point, no one knows.) Three days later, agents from Homeland Security Investigations visited Ulbricht's 15th Street home in San Francisco. They found him at home, where his two housemates knew him as \"Josh.\" One of them told the agents that \"Josh\" was \"always home in his room on the computer.\" As for Ulbricht himself, he refused to answer most questions, though he did volunteer one curious bit of information, apparently as a way of indicating that such documents could be obtained so easily that anyone might have ordered them, or that he had been framed. \"Hypothetically,\" he told the agents, anyone could visit a site named \"Silk Road\" on \"Tor\" and order any drugs or fake IDs they wanted.", "lede": "If you've been living under a cultural rock the Dread Pirate Robe...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Twitter Reveals $1 Billion IPO Plan", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 09:31:46", "content": "Twitter Inc. on Thursday revealed plans to raise up to $1 billion in a public offering, looking to cash in on a messaging service that has transformed public conversation but is still losing money and facing challenges attracting new users and advertisers. Twitter's Annotated S-1 Read the full document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with key sections highlighted. Twitter released the filing for its initial public offering on Thursday. The social media company did not specify the amount of shares or price range, but set a maximum amount for the deal at $1 billion. MarketWatch's Dan Gallagher reports. (Photo: Getty Images) Potential buyers for the first time saw the financials behind one of the most anticipated stock-market debuts of the year, which showed the social network's revenue more than doubled to $254 million in the first six months of this year. But its net loss grew by 40% to $69 million as the company's expenses ballooned. Twitter's user growth is also slowing, and prices for advertisements, which make up the bulk of the company's revenue, are falling. \"They certainly have a lot of work ahead of them to get mainstream America to understand\" how Twitter works, said Brian Solis, an analyst at the Altimeter Group. Twitter had previously shielded the figures by filing its initial IPO documents confidentially in July, under a new federal law. The amount raised in the filing is an estimate that could change when Twitter launches its investor \"roadshow,\" where it will formally pitch its stock to investors. The document suggests Twitter recently valued itself at about $9.7 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding, or at about $13 billion when including equity awards. Twitter chose TWTR as its ticker symbol but hasn't specified whether it will trade on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market .

Bios: Who's Who at Twitter Read about the leaders and founders of Twitter. In seven years, Twitter has grown from a wobbly startup to a social phenomenon where in just 140 characters its 215 million monthly active users tap out more than 500 million messages each day. The short-message service serves as a global forum in which users break news, organize protests and gripe about what they ate for lunch. As early as 2008, Twitter turned eyewitnesses into \"citizen journalists\" who reported on a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Now, once-elusive public figures including the pope, Warren Buffett and Kanye West \"tweet\" their thoughts and interact with other users. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo uses the service to answer users' troubleshooting queries. Businesses, stock pickers and politicians alike analyze the sentiments expressed on Twitter as important indicators. Despite its ubiquity, Twitter remains an immature business. The filing showed Twitter has far fewer users and generates less revenue per user than Facebook . When Facebook filed for a public offering, the company revealed sales of $3.7 billion and a profit of $1 billion for 2011. It also had 845 million monthly active users, a huge bragging point as it pitched itself to investors. Twitter's growth is also a question. The majority of Twitter's revenue, about 75%, is from the U.S., even though three-quarters of monthly users are outside the U.S. Facebook also has a wide gap between its usage and its ad revenue outside the U.S., where advertising businesses typically are less mature. In the second quarter, Twitter's growth in monthly active users slowed to 7% from three months earlier, compared with 10% to 11% growth in the prior three quarters. Like Facebook, Twitter makes money mostly by selling advertising based on users' posts. As they compete for advertisers, both companies position themselves as the world's online town square. Twitter also has as a second business licensing its data companies that analyze user tweets for insights on news events and social trends. That business generated $47.5 million in revenue last year, roughly 15% of the total. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is spearheading Twitter's IPO, but its rival Morgan Stanley won a measure of vindication by landing the second-biggest role in the deal. Morgan Stanley had led Facebook's IPO, and was criticized after Facebook shares fell as much as 50% in their first three months of trading, though the stock has since recovered and is well above its initial price. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. also is in the lead group of banks, meaning that the same three banks that led Facebook's IPO will lead Twitter's. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank AG are also serving as underwriters. The largest Twitter shareholder specified in the filing is co-founder Evan Williams , who owns 12% before the offering. He became Twitter's CEO in 2008 before being replaced by Mr. Costolo in 2010. At Twitter's most-recent internal valuation, Mr. Williams' stake would be valued at nearly $1.2 billion. Other major shareholders listed in the filing include venture-capital firm Benchmark Capital, which owns 6.7% and invested in Twitter early on; co-founder Jack Dorsey, with 4.9%; and Mr. Costolo, who holds 1.6%. Based on the internal valuation, Benchmark's stake would be valued at about $651 million; Mr. Dorsey's stake would be worth roughly $483 million; and Mr. Costolo's shares would be valued at about $155 million. Four other venture-capital firms, Rizvi Traverse, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and DST Global, are listed as owning at least 5% of the shares, but specific share counts aren't listed. The clock is now ticking on when Twitter can begin its roadshow. The IPO filing must be public for at least 21 days before the company can set a price range and say how many shares it is selling. Companies typically take at least a week to travel to different cities and meet investors on the roadshow. That means if the process moves at full speed, Twitter could begin trading around the end of the month or the first week of November. As for the federal government shutdown, a person familiar with the deal said there isn't a big worry right now. But a shutdown extending three weeks or longer could possibly slow the offering if the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't operating at all when Twitter begins the roadshow, this person said. The deal will be watched by other technology companies looking to go public, such as Box Inc., an online storage company, and Square Inc., the mobile-payments company created by Mr. Dorsey. Several of those companies delayed potential public offerings after shares of Internet companies such as Facebook, Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. sagged after their debuts. But shares in Internet companies have surged this year, amid a broader rally in the U.S. stock market. \u2014Rolfe Winkler and Elizabeth Dwoskin contributed to this article.

A partnership including Jared Kushner , a 32-year-old real estate developer and technology investor, closed on Wednesday on five of six properties in a $375 million deal and he said they plan to convert them into a hub for technology companies. The Watchtower properties are being sold by the Jehovah's Witnesses, one of the largest properties the church has sold as it relocates its headquarters upstate. An agreement to sell the sixth building would close in 2017. The 1.2 million-square-foot complex will be at least 50% offices, said a person familiar with the matter, with bigger and pricier spaces aimed at more mature companies than most in the neighborhood. The partners would undertake a roughly $100 million renovation of the buildings, accommodating up to 5,000 bikes, creating outdoor roof space, allowing for 150,000 square feet of retail space occupied almost entirely by Brooklyn companies and installing state-of-the-art Internet connectivity. Mr. Kushner, chief executive of Kushner Companies, said the developers would work with the city to try to convert some area streets into pedestrian plazas. \"We saw these buildings as an opportunity to really create a great campuslike environment,\" Mr. Kushner said. To many neighborhood observers, the plans for the complex would solidify the transformation of Dumbo\u2014one of Brooklyn's main office districts\u2014from its status in the early 2000s as an offbeat neighborhood for startups into a high-profile office destination that competes with neighborhoods like Flatiron and Chelsea. \"Dumbo will become more official, more formal and more professionalized by these tenants,\" said Chris Havens, a commercial broker who worked for five years at Two Trees Management Co., the largest property owner in the area. \"It's turned from a village into a town.\" Rents at the tech campus would be in the mid-$50s per square foot, according to people familiar with the matter. That would make them about double the rents in the rest of Dumbo, and about $10 below rents for hip Manhattan spaces. Bloomberg News Jared Kushner, above in February, sees 'an opportunity to really create a great campus-like environment' in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood. Mr. Kushner said he and his partners, RFR Realty and LIVWRK Holdings, a real-estate startup by Asher Abehsera, a former Two Trees' executive, weighed whether the complex should include more housing or office space. \"We would make more money if we did the whole thing as residential, but we would have less fun,\" Mr. Kushner said. The decision to focus more on office space is likely an easier sell to the community. Mr. Kushner and his partners would need to rezone parts of the property they would convert to residential use, which requires approval from the local City Council member, Stephen Levin. Mr. Levin said he hasn't been briefed on the details of the plans but said Mr. Kushner seemed savvy about the need for more office space in the area. The area under the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge overpasses was once one of Brooklyn's main manufacturing hubs, home to firms like Arbuckle Brothers and makers of the Brillo pad. The cobble-stoned neighborhood went into steep decline in the late 20th Century as companies moved their operations out of the city, but it began experiencing a residential revival in the 1970s when artists started moving in. By the 1980s, a few companies began moving in, and today the area has some 1.8 million square feet of office space. \"Dumbo has not been this tight since 1945, since World War II,\" Mr. Havens said. The history of the Jehovah's Witnesses site mirrors Brooklyn's industrial decline. The printing facility, operated through much of the 20th century, was once the largest in the city, producing hundreds of millions of Bibles, books, magazines and pamphlets, according to Richard Devine, a church spokesman. The organization closed its printing operations in the city in 2004 as large-scale modern equipment demanded more sprawling facilities. The organization's plans for a new campus upstate became known in 2009. Since then developers and community leaders have speculated about the future of the printing site, the most prominent development opportunity in an area dominated by landmarked funky warehouse buildings. The city also recently announced a deal with a developer to convert the Empire Stores, vacant warehouse buildings in Dumbo, to retail and about 300,000 square feet of office space. Two Trees executives said they aren't concerned about competition with a huge block of new office space because rents for newer spaces are significantly higher and their buildings tend to appeal to smaller companies. \"We're at zero vacancy. If Dumbo continues to become a home for these types of company, I think supply contributes to that perception,\" said David Lombino, director of special projects at Two Trees. \"A rising tide lifts all boats.\" Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com A version of this article appeared October 4, 2013, on page A25 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Deal Will Transform Dumbo.", "lede": "For four years, a cluster of properties near the foot of the Manh...", "link": "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304906704579113823704492920.html"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Samsung Predicts Record Profit", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:05:44", "content": "Article Excerpt BY MIN-JEONG LEE AND JONATHAN CHENG SEOUL\u2014Samsung Electronics Co. issued guidance for record operating profit in the third quarter, but the company could face pressure from shareholders to unleash its cash pile as saturation in the smartphone market threatens a slowdown in earnings growth for the South Korean company.

(After all, consumers don't camp out for days to buy new cars or clothes.) So it isn't surprising that one fan set out to erect a photographic shrine to every single Apple product ever created, from the Apple I computer in 1976 to the iPad mini. Apple Products Through the Years Jonathan Zufi See a selection of photos from a new coffee-table book about Apple products. Photos and captions by Jonathan Zufi. Four years ago, Jonathan Zufi, a 42-year-old Australian native, began buying up more than 500 products: desktops, Apple's first commercial printer and iPods\u2014some in vintage packaging. He rented a storage unit to hold all the goods. He built a studio in the basement of his Atlanta home to photograph them, placing each item carefully against the same type of futuristic white backdrop used on apple.com and in Apple stores. He got a photography professor to help him learn to take professional shots. \"I wanted to create a repository where people who also love the company and its products could go and reminisce,\" says Mr. Zufi, a mobility expert at SAP America Inc. who says he has never worked for Apple Inc. The idea, he says, was to trace the company's evolution both in electronics and design from a user's point of view. \"I want people who are a bit younger who think Apple just makes things that start with \"i\" to know this company used to make clunky printers.\" The result is a collection of more than 150,000 photos, some 3,500 of which Mr. Zufi displays on a website (www.shrineofapple.com) and more than 650 of which he has curated into a new 326-page coffee-table-sized book. \"Iconic: A Photographic Tribute to Apple Innovation,\" is self-published and available at www.iconicbook.com. A new self-published book, \"Iconic,\" offers catnip to Apple zealots. Photographer and Apple enthusiast Jonathan Zufi assembled a photographic tribute to every product Apple ever made. Photo: Jonathan Zufi A paean to the evolution of the personal computer and a company that changed consumer behavior, it looks like the kind of book Apple itself might market\u2014except that the company has long been adamant about focusing on the future rather than celebrating its past. Apple even donated its old hardware, papers, and other historical materials to Stanford University in 1997. Representatives from Apple didn't respond to requests for comment about the project. Unlike many other books about Apple, Mr. Zufi's consists of photos and little text. There is a circuit board from the original Apple computer, the Apple I, which \"now seems as primitive as the Model T,\" writes Daniel Kottke, one of the company's original employees, in an introduction to a chapter on desktops. There's the Apple II, circa 1977, one of the first successful home computers, and a Macintosh prototype in a transparent case\u2014which Mr. Zufi says illustrates co-founder Steve Jobs ' obsession with making computer electronics fit a particular design. There's a \"Flower Power\" iMac G3, known for its brightly-colored plastic bubble-shaped design, and an Apple Lisa 2, which was a commercial failure. There are digital cameras and joysticks. There's also an entire chapter on packaging\u2014another Apple design obsession. Along the way, Mr. Zufi met with collectors around the country, loading dusty collections of valuable prototypes into rental cars and photographing them, sometimes in makeshift studios in hotel rooms. He convinced Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak to contribute a foreword to the book. In an email, Mr. Wozniak said Mr. Zufi included equipment that few would even know about, including Mr. Wozniak himself. The work \"blows me away,\" he said. Mr. Zufi says his original goal of shooting every Apple product will be impossible to meet. \"I am still finding out about products they dabbled with, released in limited numbers in specific markets, and so on,\" he says. While he has emptied the storage unit and sold most of the items he bought, about 15 remain, including an enormous monitor in his garage, he says.

News Corp 's HarperCollins Publishers has agreed to make available the majority of its U.S. backlist titles to a books subscription service operated by Scribd Inc., a Web-based service. The move increases the number of titles available on Scribd's subscription service to more than 50,000 available from traditional publishers, Scribd said. But HarperCollins isn't making its new titles available, which could limit the service's appeal. Neither side would disclose the precise number of older books coming from HarperCollins. Scribd is one of a number of online book-subscription programs emerging, as technology executives explore whether the success of subscription offerings in music and television can be emulated with books. \"We want to be the Netflix of books,\" said Trip Adler, chief executive of Scribd, a San Francisco-based company that is closely held by its founders and a small group of equity investors. Scribd offers unlimited access to its titles for $8.99 a month. The company, whose online platform hosts e-books and documents from numerous sources, also will sell new and backlist titles from all HarperCollins's U.S. imprints. Other publishers providing books to the Scribd subscription service include Kensington Publishing Corp., which is providing new and old titles. \"We're interested in exploring the subscription model and seeing how it performs,\" said Steve Zacharius, Kensington's chief executive. Among other new subscription services is a company called Oyster, which launched in September. Oyster subscribers paying $9.95 a month have unlimited access to more than 100,000 titles. North Carolina-based eReatah Inc. is expected to launch later this month with 90,000 new and old titles from traditional publishers. Unlike Scribd and Oyster, eReatah will offer a tiered pricing approach. HarperCollins has struck deals to supply a limited number of titles to both eReatah and Oyster. CBS Corp.'s Simon &amp; Schuster has also struck a deal to supply books to eReatah. But most other major publishers have been wary about striking deals with subscription services, worried about cannibalizing book sales. Book executives also question whether consumers will embrace such subscription services, particularly as the new services have limited books available, particularly among new releases. \"If somebody wants the new Stephen King or John Grisham, and they can't get it, they'll go somewhere else,\" said Carol Fitzgerald, president of the Book Report Inc., a closely held company that operates a network of websites connecting books and readers. \"Also, can't people do this through their local library and get whatever they want?\" HarperCollins isn't providing new titles to Scribd subscription users. \"I don't know if it makes sense strategically to include new books,\" said Brian Murray, chief executive of HarperCollins, noting the potential for conflict with book retailers. HarperCollins is a unit of News Corp, which also owns The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Murray added that he considered the agreement with Scribd to be significant because of its \"huge installed base of active users and its global reach.\" Scribd claims 80 million active users and is available in 100 countries.

STEWART and SUZANNE VRANICA The website Songsrpeople.com looks a lot like other amateur-video sites. It is wallpapered with clips featuring \"the most insane amusement park ever\" and \"your girlfriend's six friends.\" The site draws tens of thousands of visitors a month, according to audience measurement firms. It also has ads for national brands, including Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and State Farm. But Web-security investigators at a firm called White Ops contend that most of the site's visitors aren't people. Rather, they are computer-generated visitors, or \"bots,\" designed to fool advertisers into paying for the traffic, says White Ops, which has blacklisted the site\u2014and thousands more like it\u2014so that ads from clients such as Zipcar don't land there. An anonymous representative for Songsrpeople declined to discuss the site's traffic but in an email called the White Ops methodology into question. State Farm said it was looking into the matter while Target declined to comment and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Authorities and Internet-security experts say tens of thousands of dubious websites are popping up across the Internet. Their phony Web traffic is often fueled by \"botnets,\" zombie armies of hijacked PCs that are controlled from unknown locations around the world, according to Internet security experts. The sites take advantage of the simple truth that advertisers pay to be seen. This creates an incentive for fraudsters to erect sites with phony traffic, collecting payments\u2014often through middlemen and sometimes directly from advertisers. \"When you walk into this world, you walk with eyes wide open,\" said Brian Harrington, chief marketing officer at Zipcar, which ran a recent ad campaign, assisted by White Ops to filter out bogus traffic. \"You know stuff is not real.\" At their most sophisticated, botnets can mimic the behavior of online consumers, clicking from one site to the next, pausing at ads, watching videos, and even putting items in shopping carts. Earlier in the year, an FBI operation, \"Ghost Click,\" resulted in two men from Estonia pleading guilty in U.S. federal court in New York for their roles in a botnet ad-fraud scheme. The fraud involved four million hijacked computers in 100 different countries and yielded at least $14 million for a group of seven, federal prosecutors said. \"It's drug-level money, but you don't have to kill anyone,\" says Tamer Hassan, a co-founder and chief technology officer of White Ops, a year-old startup in New York that has developed technology that it says can spot robotic traffic and uncover digital ad fraud. Security experts say that botnets can be rented or purchased on private forums and message boards around the world. In a translation of one proposal written in Russian, a member called \"Shantaram\" offers to drive 1,000 visitors to any website for $1, noting that it can source the traffic to any country \"desired.\" Hackers build botnets by infecting computers with malware, which are regularly buried in email attachments or disguised as legitimate website downloads. Those infected computers are then connected by a command machine, which stealthily directs the network of zombies to do its work, whatever it may be. A computer user may not be aware of it. Ad industry executives blame the murky and complicated online ad ecosystem for creating an environment for the fraud. Most publishers, big and small, sell inventory through multiple channels, using middlemen who aggregate space across a host of sites and resell it to brands. The middlemen include ad networks, which often have sales teams, as well as ad exchanges, which employ automated systems that allow advertisers to bid on publishers' inventory. That inventory can be supplied either directly by the publisher, by ad networks, or through other companies that help websites sell their ad space. It isn't unusual for marketers to now have ads running across hundreds of different websites, elevating the chances that ads could land on questionable sites, unbeknownst to the advertiser. Even when advertisers find out their ads ran on a botnet-fueled site, there's no formal process for them to get their money back, ad buyers say. Automated systems have \"enabled greater buying efficiencies and controls, but also made it easier for the bad guys,\" said Arthur Muldoon, co-founder and chief executive of the media buying firm Accordant Media, whose clients include Starwood Hotels, Seamless and Zipcar. To sift out bad traffic, Accordant uses a growing cast of security and verification companies, including comScore Inc., DoubleVerify and White Ops. Last year it doubled the money it spent on their services. Accordant also has a swelling blacklist of sites where it won't buy ads. That list has tripled from last year and now includes hundreds of thousands of sites. White Ops was founded by Mr. Hassan, Michael J.J. Tiffany, Ash Kalb and well-known Internet security researcher Dan Kaminsky about a year ago and operates out of a science-fiction bookstore in Brooklyn. Early on, the company chased bank fraud schemes. But that changed when someone at a party showed Mr. Tiffany a snapshot on his iPhone: a $900,000 check from an ad network. The acquaintance said he had gamed the ad network into thinking he hosted sites with big traffic. \"It got me thinking, 'We should take a look at this,'\" said Mr. Tiffany, the chief executive of the company. White Ops has cataloged tens of thousands of suspect websites. Its technology identifies bots in real time and then prevents ads from going to the bad sites. The aim is to strike at the cash flow of the scam sites instead of trying to put \"guys in handcuffs,\" Mr. Tiffany says. Digital ad spending in the U.S. is expected to jump 14.9% this year to $42.3 billion, according to eMarketer. Most websites make money from advertisers based on how many people visit the sites. While low traffic sites can earn 25 cents per thousand views, more well-known sites can make as much as $20 for every thousands views. Video ads tend to fetch higher ad rates. Some experts say ad networks and exchanges aren't screening the publishers they work with well enough, and therefore are partly responsible for botnet-related fraud. Critics say the middlemen have a conflict of interest, since they get a cut of fees advertisers pay. \"If they reduce the fraud, they reduce their revenue,\" said Jeremiah Grossman, founder and chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security, a Web-application security firm in Santa Clara, Calif. \"Follow the money\u2014the blame [for the fraud] lies with the entity that gains the most,\" said Susan Bidel, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \"That would be the publishers and every middleman that gets a fee to process [the ad buy]. They are all complicit in some way, whether they are actively complicit or passively.\" The middlemen say they are doing their best to stamp out fraud using their own filter techniques and policing teams to weed out fraudulent publishers. They reject the notion that they are turning a blind eye to botnets. \"Everybody recognizes that this is a problem,\" said Steve Sullivan, vice president of advertising technology at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a digital ad industry trade group. \"The reality is some of those companies are in fact doing the best they can.\" While some scammers create stand-alone operations, others devise sprawling empires. In one case, the White Ops technology uncovered a zombie-populated lifestyle network, with hundreds of connected sites, including bodybuildingfaq.com, financestalk.com, and abctraveling.com. No one at the sites could be reached for comment. In some scenarios, legitimate websites inadvertently set themselves up for botnet invasions when they hire companies to help boost their traffic. That can involve building audiences through methods such as paid keyword-search advertising with search engines. White Ops discovered that more than 30% of the visitors to the education portal Education.com were robots. In the past month the site received about four million unique views, according to Quantcast. A spokesman for Education.com said it was aware of the bot-traffic and that it had likely come from an initiative in the summer to boost its audience numbers. Education.com had bought traffic from a variety of legitimate sources, including search engines, to lure in new subscribers, as well as users \"who would perform well for advertisers.\" \"We shut down the program,\" the spokesman said. Online measurement company comScore said well-known websites with heavy traffic can have single digit percentages of bad traffic while lesser-known sites might get 25% of their traffic from bots. The losses to ad fraud are hard to nail down. Security company Solve Media Inc., for instance, estimates that up to 29% of display advertising traffic world-wide is driven by bot armies, and could cost advertisers roughly $10 billion dollars this year, the company said. Microsoft Corp. and security-software maker Symantec Corp. recently went after a network called Bamital, which the companies estimated had been taking in more than $1 million a year from ad fraud. A federal court order shut down Bamital and U.S. Marshals confiscated the servers behind the cyber operation. The companies are now doing forensics on the equipment, hoping to uncover in part the workings of a botnet business, as well as the location of the people behind it.

This dramatic principle is called Chekhov\u2019s gun, and it actually applies quite well to the natural world: Animals don\u2019t waste energy developing worthless characteristics. Traits that help a species survive get passed along through generations, while those that are no longer useful fade away (or in the stubbornly contrary case of the human appendix, abruptly explode). If Chekhov had time-traveled back between 8 million and 20 million years and met Platybelodon \u2014 an ancestor of the modern elephant that looked like it got hit in the face with a shovel, then absorbed that shovel into its mouth \u2014 he would have demanded the creature explain itself. What possible purpose could such a ridiculous trait serve? \u201cA good one, thank you very much,\u201d Platybelodon would reply, probably in a really funny voice. The spork-faced Platybelodon\u2019 s strange jutting jaw actually consists of a second pair of flattened, widened tusks (tusks themselves being modified incisors). When the genus Platybelodon , which means \u201cflat tooth,\u201d and its species were first described in the 1920s, \u201ctheir lower incisors were thought to function to shovel, scoop, dig and dredge soft vegetation in aquatic or swampy environments,\u201d vertebrate paleontologist William Sanders of the University of Michigan wrote in an email to WIRED. \u201cBut recent analysis of tusk wear surfaces show that they were used more as scythes to cut tough vegetation.\u201d The paleontologist who proposed this slicing behavior in 1992, David Lambert, theorized that instead of roaming shorelines, Platybelodon fed on terrestrial plants, grasping branches with its trunk and cutting them away with its built-in scythe. Indeed, cross-sections of the tusks reveal a structure that provides extra strength and resistance to abrasion for such foraging, said Sanders. So it could well be that Platybelodon wandered around Miocene Asia, Africa, and North America, scything vegetation like some sort of peasant, only without all the pesky class struggles. And it was just one of a horde of similar animals in the family Gomphotheriidae , all with modified lower tusks of varying styles. The Platybelodon genus alone had more than 15 species, reaching \u201cthe apex of development of these lower tusks,\u201d according to Sanders. Their radically flattened teeth suggest \u201cstrong selection for specialized feeding on a particular range of plants,\u201d which was crucial given that \u201cfor much of the Miocene there were often three to five or more genera of proboscideans occurring in the same landscape, competing for forage.\u201d Pegging the various appearances of such proboscideans, though, is difficult, because flesh-like schnozes don\u2019t fossilize as easily as bone. We\u2019re actually quite lucky to have Platybelodon preserved at all, considering that fossilization is a really hard thing to pull off . Even if you can avoid getting carted off in a dozen different directions by scavengers, you need to settle in the right spot. And Platybelodon just so happened to do us a solid by dying \u2014 sometimes en masse \u2014 next to or in rivers, the prime locales for fossilization. Henry Fairfield Osborn, a paleontologist who described Platybelodon in a 1932 paper and quite extensively four years later in his book Proboscidea , accordingly assumed the creature to be a water-dredger (thanks to the work of Lambert and others we now believe that Platybelodon , like a lot of animals, was probably just partial to water and happened to sometimes die in it). In his book, Osborn quoted another paleontologist, Alexei Borissiak, who in 1929 wrote that Platybelodon was \u201cdeprived of a trunk\u201d but would scoop through the water and \u201cseize its food with its muscular upper lip, covering the mandible.\u201d In fact, Borissiak reckoned Platybelodon\u2019 s snout looked a bit like that of the hippopotamus, \u201calthough much more lengthened out.\u201d Osborn\u2019s illustrations of Platybelodon certainly reflect this. But \u201cthink about what an elephant looks like,\u201d Sanders asks us. \u201cThe trunk is a very separate entity from the mouth. You have to be able to get food into your mouth, and if your front limbs are occupied in posture, and you have upper and lower tusks that would make it difficult to have a long projecting tongue or mobile lips, then you need a proboscis.\u201d \u201c[Osborn's] ego preceded his expertise,\u201d he added, \u201cand we are still digging out from the weight of his \u2018authority\u2019 on proboscideans.\u201d Yet Osborn\u2019s flat trunk/lip persists in most modern reconstructions \u2014 including an oh-so-close-to-actually-being-cute one in the Ice Age movies \u2014 conflicting with Lambert\u2019s more widely accepted grab-and-scythe theory. Trunks aside, could the bizarre mug of Platybelodon , so wonderfully adapted for feeding, have proved cumbersome when, say, fleeing from predators? Sanders doesn\u2019t think so. And even if Platybelodon did face-plant here and there, its size would have proved quite the advantage as far as not getting eaten goes. It was somewhat smaller than the modern African elephant, which only rarely falls prey to that continent\u2019s apex predator, the lion. But according to Sanders, Platybelodon might have had a counterpart predator in the ferocious wolf-like creodonts , meaning \u201cflesh tooth,\u201d meaning a slicing tooth designed to deprive you of flesh, meaning let\u2019s be grateful it was Platybelodon worrying about them and not us. So be they teeth like scissors or teeth like a shovel, evolution never creates a rifle it doesn\u2019t intend to fire.

It was also popularized by photographer Vincent Laforet, who used a tilt-shift lens to make the real world look like a miniature model of itself (check the photos here and here ). It was a different way of seeing things that was surprising and fun to look at. The problem is, most of us aren\u2019t as good as Laforet, so we have to proceed with caution if we\u2019re going to make effective selective-focus pictures. Too often we get sidetracked by the technique and forget to make a picture that can stand on its own. Boring food photo? Shoot it with a selective focus lens or apply the feature in Instagram, and voil\u00e0! \u2014 a slightly less boring food photo. This misuse, or overuse, puts Lensbaby and its Pro Effects Kit (made for Canon and Nikon DSLRs) in a tough position. The kit offers two selective-focus optics, two macro converters, and a carrying case. It all costs $730, which is a good chunk of change to spend on something that should probably be used sparingly. Another knock against the kit is that it\u2019s not the easiest thing to use. To attach Lensbaby optics to your DSLR you first have to snap something called the Composer Pro onto your camera\u2019s lens mount. The Composer Pro comes with the kit and is the piece that, using a ball and joint system, lets you swivel the optics around and choose where you want your spot of focus, or \u201csweet spot,\u201d to land. Then you choose which optic \u2014 the \u201cSweet 35\u2033 (35mm focal length) or the \u201cEdge 80\u2033 (80mm focal length) \u2014 to insert into the composer. Being able to choose different optics is a nice feature, but inserting and removing the optics is a total pain. The first time I mounted the Sweet 35 I thought it was secure but it fell out as soon as I picked up the camera. To remove an optic you have to master a push and spin technique that is not easy. I thought I broke the optics several times because I had to push so hard. It takes a minute to figure out how to control the swivel of the composer and place the sharp spot of your focus. But after a while it becomes fairly routine. In terms of ease of use, I prefer the Edge 80. At that focal length your sharp spot of focus is more defined and easier to place where you want it. Once I got the hang of everything, I admit I had fun testing the kit. It was a refreshing challenge to try and find \u201cappropriate\u201d uses for the optics, and I never had any complaints about the quality of the glass and the sharpness of my pictures. Both optics are reasonably fast \u2014 the aperture on the Edge 80 goes to 2.8 and the aperture on the Sweet 35 goes to 2.5 \u2014 so they performed well in low light on my Canon 5D Mark II. Since the test, however, the optics just sit in my bag. That\u2019s partly because I\u2019m in front a computer most of the time. But it\u2019s also because I find myself weary of pulling them out unless I\u2019ve planned a shoot that highlights their strengths. The entire Lensbaby Pro Effects Kit costs considerably less than one Nikon or Canon tilt shift lens ($1,300 \u2013 $2,500), which also creates a selective focus effect. But dollar for dollar I can think of several other $730 purchases I\u2019d rather have in my camera bag quiver. If you\u2019re set on using a selective focus lens on your DSLR, you can buy the Composer Pro with just the Sweet 35 for $380. The Edge 80 by itself sells for $300. If that\u2019s still too much, you might try the Lensbaby Spark. It\u2019s a low-end 50mm selective focus optic with a fixed aperture that you focus with rubberized bellows. It\u2019s not half as sharp as the Sweet 35 or the Edge 80, but at $90 it\u2019s a good way to get your feet wet. The photos you get with the Spark often resemble something you\u2019d get from a toy camera, but if used with a little ingenuity, it can be a lot of fun and you\u2019ll spend a lot less money trying to figure out if selective focus photography is indeed for you.

But Cady Coleman found a way to get Sandra Bullock\u2019s. All she had to do was go into space. Back in 2011 the NASA astronaut was on an expedition on the International Space Station while her brother Chris Coleman was on Earth \u2013 California, specifically \u2013 meeting a man whose sister-in-law happened to be Bullock. The two got to talking about what their family members did and decided they needed to connect Coleman and Bullock, who was about to star in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s lost-in-space flick Gravity . \u201cIt took a week or so to be able to talk [to her] just because we have an internet-protocol phone on the station that we can use to make calls, but I needed her cell phone number \u2013 you can\u2019t call us, we can call you,\u201d Coleman told WIRED, while not on a space station. \u201cShe\u2019s probably not so used to giving out that cell phone number so I had to write and say, \u2018You can give me your number, I won\u2019t give it away.\u2019\u201d Eventually Coleman, who has logged more than 4,330 hours in space for NASA on two space shuttle missions and that stint on the ISS, was able to chat with Bullock \u2014 from space \u2014 and give her advice on everything from how to move in zero gravity to how to deal with the psychological toll of being unable to go home (something Bullock\u2019s Ryan Stone struggles with heavily while trying to get back to Earth in Gravity ). She also began recording voice memos of things she thought might be helpful for the actress and sending her audio clips of helpful pointers. \u201cI\u2019d be going about my work and think, \u2018Oh Sandra would probably want to know about this,\u2019\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIt did kind of make me fly around the space station with new eyes, because I was trying to be Sandra\u2019s eyes.\u201d It worked. Bullock\u2019s performance in Gravity is shattering, and the film \u2014 in Coleman\u2019s eyes \u2014 is the most accurate portrayal of her actual experiences in space ever to make it to the big screen (minus the debris collisions). WIRED asked Coleman about her talks with Bullock, truth in Hollywood movies, and the importance of female astronauts in movies. WIRED: Visually, Gravity feels incredibly life-like. How close is it \u2013 visually \u2013 to what you\u2019ve experienced as an astronaut? Cady Coleman: Something that\u2019s frustrating to me in my job is that I think it\u2019s a very special job. It\u2019s been a great privilege to go to space and to see the things that I see. Really, just to be up there doing work that you just know is really important in such a special place, and yet you don\u2019t really get to bring anybody that you know and love with you. A movie like this is a way for me to bring people to space. I will bring my mother to this. I will make everybody in my family go see this. I don\u2019t know what other people who haven\u2019t seen space think, but I feel like you get to see the view. I met Cuar\u00f3n in the last couple weeks and he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been to space!\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t been to space \u2013 since you made that movie.\u201d WIRED: Was there anything that felt inauthentic? Coleman: I couldn\u2019t help but look at some things and go, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d do that.\u2019 But that\u2019s not the point of the movie. I don\u2019t know if when Apollo 13 came out everyone ran around going \u2018Is that real? Is that real?\u2019 because [it wasn't] quite as sensational \u2026 But people do ask [about how authentic Gravity is], and partly they\u2019re asking because, boy, if it\u2019s that real then why would anybody ever go? It\u2019s sensational. It\u2019s a lot of things that maybe could happen, but for them all to happen on the same day is more than coincidental. But they\u2019re all things that we consider at NASA. WIRED: Yeah, space debris is obviously out there and a concern for space travel. How likely is it that astronauts would get pummeled by it the way they are in this movie? Coleman: In Gravity there\u2019s the debris storm that we see in the trailers, and the astronauts are knocked free and they\u2019re spinning in space. Well, we think about that all the time when we\u2019re doing space walks because it\u2019s really the worst thing in the world that could happen. So, what do we do at NASA? We make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s a really real risk, but we do what we can to mitigate it. I think that\u2019s true of some of the other things you see in Gravity \u2013 what makes it scary in the movie is that it is real, but not real to that extent. WIRED: What was your brother doing when he met Bullock\u2019s brother-in-law? Coleman: My little brother is a wine guy in Sonoma. He\u2019s in the innovative wine-packaging business. Specialty-cask sampling is I think how I\u2019m supposed to say it. As his sister I\u2019m not allowed to say that he does really, really high-end wine in a bag, but that\u2019s what he does. He met Sandra Bullock\u2019s brother-in-law and they got together and figured out what their sisters and sister-in-laws did and got us together. Sandra and I did this interview together recently \u2013 it was specifically for NASA, to air on a NASA channel \u2013 and the interviewer said, \u2018How did you and Cady meet?\u2019 And she looks at me and she says, \u2018Wine.\u2019 I had to look at her and go, \u201cWe have to start again, because if we don\u2019t they can\u2019t use it. We can\u2019t use an interview that starts with \u2018wine.\u2019\u201d WIRED: So what kind of advice did you give Sandra Bullock when you called her from the ISS? Coleman: My recollection is that we mostly talked about two kinds of things. One was physically how do you move up there? What do you hold on to? Are you fluid, are you angular, are you sort of dragging yourself around? The other was what it felt like to live in a place so far away from everybody that you know on the ground. And how do you deal with that separation and the fact that you can\u2019t just go home when you want. WIRED: What is that strain like? Coleman: Even the training is hard on your family \u2013 on your family life. It\u2019s hard to be away from your kid. [Ed. Note: Coleman has a husband and 13-year-old son.] Yet I feel like I was selected for this job and trained and invested a lot, and I believe in what we do and that it\u2019s the right thing for me to be at work when I\u2019m at work and not at home. But I think there\u2019s an emotional price that you pay for that compartmentalization. WIRED: Did you enjoy the fact that that lead in this film was a female astronaut? Coleman: I did. I love it when the hero of a film is a woman. And it\u2019s a woman who uses her head and thinks out what she knows and when that doesn\u2019t work she thinks again and she\u2019s very persistent. These are a lot of qualities that I think are very important that are going to be portrayed to a bunch of 13-year-old girls and they\u2019re going to think they\u2019re normal. They\u2019re going to realize that it\u2019s normal to be the hero. That it could be them \u2013 the hero could be them. The number of people that ask me if I feel bad about leaving my kid at home is too many to count, right? Sometimes I resent that they don\u2019t ask the guys the same question, which is insulting to the guys who also miss their kids. The answer is, \u201cYes, I feel really bad, but it is also the right thing to do.\u201d WIRED: Did any of that thinking inform your conversations with Bullock? Coleman: There has to be a little part of her that is thinking when we first talked, \u201cOk, I\u2019m talking to a woman that\u2019s just like left her kid on the planet and went away and didn\u2019t think anything of it. What kind of woman can do that?\u201d I think we went from that to realizing that I\u2019m the same kind of woman that feels badly about that but it feels like the right thing to do. I think making that human part of living in space \u2026 It\u2019s about the whole person up there. The very humanness of being up there was very clear for me and I believe that\u2019s some of what she got from talking to me.

It\u2019s yet another step in the rocky evolution of the so-called sharing economy, where companies such as Airbnb attempt to facilitate a more fluid exchange of goods and services via the internet. Most of the clashes over what\u2019s also being called \u201ccollaborative consumption\u201d have taken place in the heavily regulated arenas of rooms and rides. Airbnb chalked up a victory in one of the most recent disputes. Instead of gloating, however, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky extended a self-interested olive branch. Following New Yorker Nigel Warren\u2019s successful appeal of his $2,400 fine for renting out a room through Airbnb, Chesky said the company wants to work with New York City to create a clear legal framework for people to rent out their rooms and homes. \u201cOur hosts are not hotels, but we believe that it makes sense for our community to pay occupancy tax, with limited exemptions for those who earn under certain thresholds,\u201d he wrote . \u201cWe would like to assist New York City in streamlining this process so that it is not onerous.\u201d Chesky\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \u201cour hosts are not hotels\u201d \u2014 is interesting because it frames the willingness to collect taxes as a concession. Sharing-economy businesses such as Airbnb tend to portray themselves as platforms for facilitating connections between private individuals. Airbnb isn\u2019t running a hotel chain, the logic goes: it\u2019s helping people extract value from an unused asset \u2014 in this case, an apartment that would otherwise sit empty while the tenant is away for the weekend. As such, Airbnb\u2019s willingness to allow the collection of the city\u2019s hotel occupancy tax is a way of making nice, versus an alternative approach such as, say, battling the city in court over the definition of \u201chotel.\u201d If such a tax plan goes into effect, the money involved would probably be rather large. Airbnb says 15,000 people rent out their spaces through the company \u2014 87 percent of them the homes in which they live, according to Chesky. In New York City, hotel rooms renting for $40 per night or more are taxed at a rate of $2 per day per room plus 5.875 percent of the rate. So, a one-bedroom apartment near Times Square listed for $139 with a minimum three-night stay would involve an occupancy tax of more than $36 total. While that kind of extra charge might seem to cramp the sharing economy\u2019s style, it\u2019s the kind of compromise that seems inevitable. In California last month, the state\u2019s public utilities commission passed the country\u2019s first uniform regulations for ride-sharing , creating a legal framework for companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar. In effect, the rules require ride-sharing companies to follow the same safety and insurance standards as traditional taxi companies \u2014 standards the ride-sharing companies say they already exceed. Without such legal sanctions, however, the only other place sharing-economy disputes are likely to end up is in court. When it comes to who gets to share what with whom and who gets paid, conflict is inevitable. The only question is whether those conflicts get resolved through legislation or litigation.", "lede": "Airbnb \u2014 the company that lets you pay to stay wherever a strange...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/airbnb-taxes/"}]}, {"cluster": 24, "articles": [{"author": "Mary Bates", "title": "Dolphin Hear, Dolphin Do: Imitation by Echolocation", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 15:26:00", "content": "Humans are born imitators. The ability to imitate others comes naturally to us and plays a major role in how we learn about the world. But imitation is not widespread in the animal kingdom. True imitation, which goes beyond merely mimicking another\u2019s behavior to include purposeful intention, is rare. Dolphins are one of the few animals that can truly imitate. In 2010, researchers at the Dolphin Research Center (DRC) in Grassy Key, Florida, showed dolphins can imitate behaviors without using their eyesight . Dolphins were trained on a \u201cdo-as-I-do\u201d game, in which a model (in this case another dolphin) performed a specific behavior and the target dolphin was asked to imitate it. A young male dolphin named Tanner was able to imitate the model dolphin\u2019s behaviors even when he was \u201cblindfolded\u201d \u2014 fitted with soft, latex eyecups that completely blocked his sight. Now, a follow-up study shows not only how Tanner accomplished this task using sound, but also that he used a deliberate, problem-solving approach to imitation. The research was published in the journal Animal Cognition . Kelly Jaakkola, lead author on the two papers and Director of Research at DRC, suspected Tanner was using sound to imitate, but there were two possibilities: \u201cHe could have recognized the characteristic sound the behavior makes, just like you or I might recognize the sound of hands clapping, or he could have used echolocation to \u201csee\u201d the behavior with sound,\u201d she says. In the follow-up study, Jaakkola and her team changed how the behaviors sounded by using a human model instead of a dolphin. Like the dolphin model, the human model performed a variety of motor behaviors including bobbing up and down, spinning in a circle, and swimming like a fish with legs and feet moving side-to-side. A person moving in the water sounds very different from a dolphin moving in the water. With the sound changed, would Tanner still be able to recognize the behavior to copy it? Jaakkola and her colleagues showed Tanner had no problem imitating the human model using sound alone. But even more interesting was how he used sound. Tanner switched strategies when imitating a dolphin and a human. Specifically, when he imitated a human blindfolded, he produced many more echolocation clicks than when he had imitated a dolphin blindfolded. \u201cWhen he had been imitating the familiar-sounding dolphin behavior, he just recognized the characteristic sound of the behavior,\u201d Jaakkola says. \u201cBut when we gave him the less familiar sound of a human doing the behavior, he switched to using echolocation.\u201d This is the first demonstration of flexibility in using a new perceptual route to imitation in any non-human animal. Not only did Tanner use a new perceptual route, he switched strategies depending on the situation. He was flexible enough to seek new information, change strategies, and change his approach to the task. Jaakkola says this shows he wasn\u2019t just copying \u201cmindlessly,\u201d but was instead engaged in imitation as an intentional, problem-solving process. These experiments demonstrate dolphins can recognize and imitate trained behaviors, but Jaakkola is also interested in investigating spontaneous imitation in problem-solving situations. So far, all dolphin imitation studies have used the \u201cdo-as-I-do\u201d procedure where the dolphin is specifically asked to imitate a learned behavior. But in the real world, much of the value of imitation comes from observing how others solve problems and then spontaneously adopting their technique. The DRC team hopes to probe dolphins\u2019 abilities to imitate novel behaviors and look into whether dolphins spontaneously use imitation to learn from each other in more natural situations. Such experiments would not only shed light on the dolphin mind, but the evolution of imitation, as well. Since true imitation is so rare in the animal kingdom, it is likely that the ability evolved separately in humans and dolphins. Learning how dolphins use their imitation skills could provide insight into why they, and humans, became imitating animals at all. \u00a0 References: Jaakkola, K., Guarino, E., and Rodriguez, M.

These latter folks are the same ones who irrationally lust over crazy-expensive stereo gear. Especially gear from one of the few premium hi-fi brands of the 20th century still left on the planet: McIntosh. Back in the day, you had to have a McIntosh rig if you were serious about music (Just ask your dad). Well, the brand with the famous blue and green blinkenlights is still very much alive, and it has birthed a new turntable. The McIntosh MT5 turntable caresses every single groove of your precious vinyl. And for the asking price of $6,500, you should expect your records to receive some extra pampering. Using some finely tuned noise-suppression technology, the MT-5 will let you hear all the nuances of your favorite records without introducing any extra rumbles or vibrations into the audio signal. The silicon acrylic platter is both massive and stable, weighing five pounds and measuring one and one-half inches thick. It\u2019s suspended magnetically and driven by a high-end Swiss-made motor that uses two opposing neodymium magnets. By floating the platter with magnetic force instead of using ball bearings at the base, low-end rumble is all but eliminated. It\u2019s also one less part to wear down. Even cooler is the detail that everyone can appreciate: The platter glows the same McIntosh-flavored bright blue-green as the front glass panel. The custom tone arm is also stabilized by magnets. The anti-skating feature (something common to all turntables) applies a counter-force to suppress the arm\u2019s natural desire to swing toward the middle of the album. But since the McIntosh\u2019s tonearm does it by way of magnets, it further reduces any motor noises or additional sounds that could creep into the audio signal and alter the sounds being pulled from the record. What you end up with is a turntable that spins silently and sounds incredible. But all the craftsmanship required to deliver a pure audio signal will cost you a heap \u2014 probably more than you laid out for your first car. At $6,500, the MT5 isn\u2019t the turntable you\u2019d want to hook up to your $250 soundbar. But if you\u2019re really serious about sound, and maybe you\u2019ve recently won the lottery, this is one of the best ways to listen to vinyl. For a test run, I\u2019d recommend Meddle by Pink Floyd ( Dark Side is for squares).

When the stock market sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring on the day of the IPO, one thing was clear to me about Tesla: branding was everything . Now that Tesla has started making its second car at scale, it has delivered a quarter profit for the first time , and its shares have traded at a high of almost $195 per share, branding is still everything for Tesla. That\u2019s why the viral video of one of Tesla\u2019s Model S cars burning could be an actual problem for Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Model S has been rated as the safest car out there by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model S that\u2019s shown in the video in flames hit some metal debris on a freeway and Tesla says the fire started in one of the modules in the battery pack. The pack fire, as it turns out , was also difficult to put out. But whether or not an internal combustion car would have had a reaction on par to the Model S when it directly hit some metal debris (or ignited the fuel tank in some way), isn\u2019t really the question. The issue is how much damage can a viral video of a Model S on fire do to Tesla\u2019s valuable brand.

An investigation in a couple of fires during safety testing with Chevy\u2019s Volt back in 2011 , seem to contribute to a considerable freeze in Volt sales for awhile. Fires certainly weren\u2019t great publicity for Fisker\u2019s electric cars back when those were on sale. Large companies with diverse product lines can weather branding and publicity issues more easily than startups that have one product on the market. If that one product turns sour, there\u2019s nothing else out there to prop up the brand. But this fire issue could end up being another hurdle Tesla jumps over. Cars get in accidents, and bad things happen in accidents. But the company will likely have to work on its own PR campaign to be transparent but also soothe any worried customers.

The meat-and-potatoes battling you do as a Caos isn't far off from other 3D Diablo -likes of the past few years. You pick from swords, hammers, spears, and so on, then you battle waves of enemies by alternating between quick and strong weapon strikes and occasional blasts of magic. Defend by holding a block button, or dodge using a slightly awkward dash maneuver. As far as the genre competition is concerned, Ascend doesn't reach the swift polish of last year's Kingdoms of Amalur , but it feels solid and responsive enough to outpace something like Too Human, \u00a0not too bad for a free-to-play entry. The game tries to set itself apart with an overarching and ongoing three-faction war, based on which god each player picks. The basic Ascend experience is a solo affair, but other players' outlines are visible if they're questing in the same region, and they glow with their faction's color. When you see those outlines, you can cast a blessing or a curse that will load their games with speed/health bonuses or annoying extra baddies, respectively. You have to accept such perks and hindrances from other players in kind. Additionally, the territories you've claimed for your god in the single-player game will sometimes be \"challenged\" by other players, and you're asked to set your current quest aside and defend them (you can easily ignore these challenges and simply forfeit your territory without much issue). This launches one-on-one online duels that play out\u00a0with no latency issues to speak of in my testing. Mixing up weapon combos, magic blasts, blocks, and dodges with the few evenly matched opponents I've faced so far have proven memorable. The only problem is that an evenly matched opponent is nearly impossible to find. This partly comes down to iffy matchmaking, since the fighter with a higher level or better loot will score the victory almost automatically. But the game's free-to-play economy makes no bones about one frustrating basic fact: If you pay, you will win. Ascend 's economy puts a price on just about everything. True, you can't buy weapons that are beyond your experience level, but that's a fairness fakeout, because purchasable upgrades and perks will absolutely bump your power, speed, defense, and recharge abilities insanely high for about 30 minutes at a time. Those passive multiplayer blessings and curses also cost in-game money, so if you want to wreak a ton of havoc or sow a bunch of favor, it will cost you. To its credit, Ascend does a decent job doling out enough of the game's \"soul\" currency to keep players plenty capable of buying above-adequate gear and a few perks here and there, with some in-game money left in the bank. There's plenty of loot in dungeons as well, though it's usually in a worn-out state that costs souls to \"repair.\" The game has a few weird kinks at the moment. For one, the \"ascend\" mechanic asks players to retire their Caos and build a new one from scratch periodically in exchange for a higher level cap on the new warrior. Restarted warriors don't rewind in quest progress, and they default to a reasonably high level anyway, with a few perks for the restart, too. Mostly, the mechanic seems built to sneak a few more microtransactions into the game\u2014pay enough souls and you can transfer even more of your older weapons and armor to your new Caos! Hmm... More troubling is the ability to absolutely run past scores of enemies in the game whenever you please. If you simply dash through a crowd of baddies, they won't do much chasing. This leads to the unintentionally hilarious discovery that opening chests will make a player invulnerable to attacks, meaning you can dash through dungeons, scoop up loot, and leave pretty much unscathed. (A lack of penalty for deaths doesn't help this, either.) As such, the \"beta\" tag is very operative here. Still, while the enemy variety is a little weak, the solid battling mechanics and fantastic art design make this far from a free-to-play throwaway. The game can seem a little needy with the microtransactions, but the core gameplay honestly doesn't seem like it was built with squeezing money as the primary driver (with the exception of \"ascending,\" anyway). That means there's little reason for gamers on a budget not to dive in and get a good bit of loot-battling under their belts. The Good You won't need to spend a single dime for a pretty decent loot-driven battle spree For a console Diablo -like, it's certainly better than Too Human The Bad Slim enemy selection A few egregious microtransaction imbalances, especially in multiplayer The ugly You can run past scores of enemies with little in the way of punishment Quirks from the game's \"beta\" state will make you feel dumb if you actually pay to play Verdict: Definitely dive in for free, at least for a lark", "lede": "Game Details Developer: Signal Studios Publisher : Microsoft Stud...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/ascend-hand-of-kul-review-free-to-pray/"}, {"author": "Kyle VanHemert", "title": "Watch: A Kinect-Powered Orchestra You Conduct by Waving Your Hands", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 16:45:00", "content": "Could a symphony orchestra keep it together without the guy in the penguin suit waving his hands around in front of them? Probably. But with the Computer Orchestra , a project by a trio of students at ECAL, an arts and design school in Switzerland, the human conductor\u2019s presence is vital. In fact, since all the players are laptops, the conductor is the only human involved. It\u2019s a chance to see how easy it really is to do the job. The project, created by Simon de Diesbach, Jonas Lac\u00f4te, and Laura Perrenoud, involves one conductor, one Kinect, and up to 24 laptops each loaded with a single sample. Those fragments, which can be selected from a preloaded library or snapped up from an in-the-works crowdsourced platform, are triggered purely by the movements of the conductor\u2019s hands. Each instrument is mapped to a section of 3-D space \u2014 move your hands through them and the samples play; hold a hand in one zone and that computer will continue to play with increasing volume. It\u2019s a chance to see how easy \u2014 or, probably, how hard \u2014 it really is to do the job, though in this case the system was designed with harmonious output in mind. \u201cNo special skills are required to make a great performance,\u201d the students explain. \u201cAnyone could do it.\u201d But the project doesn\u2019t just re-imagine the orchestra from the conductor\u2019s perspective.

With the fall of the Silk Road \u00a0comes the inevitable expectation that the underbelly of the Internet is somehow cut and something important has been removed like a dark organ of indeterminate worth and function. This is not true. As we well know, the Silk Road was not the first nor the last online market \u2013 even as the Feds celebrate their victory the Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded are angling for the crown \u2013 but the destruction of the Silk Road and, to a degree, the recent comments by the Lavabit founder, show how deeply we trust the Internet with our secrets and how readily it gives them up. We know, now, with certainty that nearly nothing is safe. However, we also know that modern encryption techniques can keep prying eyes out of nearly everything we see or do. Sites like the Silk Road are brought down by carelessness and hubris rather than technical know-how and I\u2019m sure the FBI understands as much about the security systems put in place to protect clients as any other educated amateur. It is at the intersection of human frailty and rock-hard encryption that we find ourselves at a crossroads. The great machines can keep enemies at bay as long as the gatekeeper remembers to close the door. Can we trust the cloud and can we trust anonymous services to truly keep us anonymous? Yes. However, the caveat is that when that trust is broken, it is broken catastrophically, taking down a swathe of the Internet with it. One part of the Silk Road fallout that I found particularly interesting was the site\u2019s seemingly apocryphal ability to jettison deposited Bitcoin back to the owners in the event of a raid. While this behavior hasn\u2019t been documented \u2013 it\u2019s all rumor right now \u2013 it would be an amazing solution for future systems. By learning from the mistakes of Ulbricht and the like, we can build stronger and better systems for the dissemination of information. While I don\u2019t support what went on on the Silk Road \u2013 the hacking services and illegal gun trading alone made it more like the Wild West than Utopia, not to mention the alleged murder-for-hire plots \u2013 I do support its right to exist. No government should be able to shut down a conglomeration of like-minded people who wish to do business anonymously. We cannot judge the pot dealer or the LSD buyer any more than they can judge our habits and predilections. The morality of this can be debated but the right to an anonymous exchange cannot. The Silk Road isn\u2019t dead. The FBI knows that, Ulbricht knows it, the users know it. Just as the death of Napster didn\u2019t stop the trafficking in downloaded music, this will not stop the trafficking in Bitcoin. Someone with a similar bent will build another Silk Road and another, eventually creating a machine that can bar the door without the gatekeeper\u2019s intervention. Then, it seems, we\u2019ll simply have to deal with a machine that refuses us entry because of our foibles and foolishness. The destruction of the Silk Road will teach the authorities a thing or two about Bitcoin and encryption but it will teach future Dread Pirate Roberts important lessons in evasion and obfuscation.", "lede": "After Silk\u00a0Road The Internet routes around damage. With the fall ...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/after-silk-road/"}, {"author": "Arik Hesseldahl", "title": "Silk Road Bust Raises Profile of So-Called \"Dark Web\"", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:56:04", "content": "A Large Evil Corporation Yesterday\u2019s bust of the man the FBI said is the operator of Silk Road , a secretive online marketplace for illegal drugs and various sketchy services, has brought some new attention on the \u201cDark Web.\u201d So what the heck is the Dark Web, a.k.a. the Deep Web, a.k.a. the Hidden Web, and to the extent that you would want to, how does one access it? Basically it\u2019s a network of websites that are hosted on a network reachable only by people who use Tor, which stands for The Onion Router. You can read about it here . Tor\u2019s origins lie in a project at the U.S. Naval Academy , and the point then was research into new ways of protecting government communications from the encroachments of hackers and spies. Here\u2019s how I understand how it works: When using a Tor-enabled browser, the traffic between your computer and the server that hosts the website you\u2019re visiting travels through a randomized network of nodes that comprise the Tor network. No single link in the traffic chain can be used to link back to you, making it a pretty good tool for staying anonymous (when used properly). In time, the research project moved to the open-source community, and now software that enables use of the Tor network is freely available to anyone: Bad guys selling drugs and guns, political activists trying to obfuscate their communications from a repressive government, or police doing surveillance work. Here\u2019s a screen grab of the Tor network I used today, which was created using a program called Vidalia. Today I downloaded a Tor Browser Bundle that contains both Vidalia, which sets up the network, and a tweaked version of the Firefox Web browser. You can find versions that work for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, several of which are customized for different languages, here . After installing, I had what I was told was an anonymized connection to the Web \u2014 that is, the conventional Web. \u201cCongratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor,\u201d a welcome page said. I could search Google for something to help me carry out a criminal act or post a message on some forum without having to worry about any of it ever being traced back to me. In practice, using a browser in this manner is slower than you\u2019re probably used to. All that extra traffic to obfuscate your actual IP address and location takes its toll on the experience. So don\u2019t expect the same zippy Web you\u2019d likely enjoy without all the Tor infrastructure. Otherwise, it was just like using a conventional browser. But here\u2019s where the Dark Web comes in. That same cloak of anonymity that works for an individual browser also works for someone who wants to host a website. There is a pseudo top-level domain known as .onion that is not part of the global domain name registry but that works with Tor-enabled browsers. There\u2019s a Wikipedia article here that gets into more of the technical nitty gritty if you\u2019re interested, but the main thing to know is that these addresses are weird, hard to memorize and probably change regularly, so your mileage may vary. For example, the old address of Silk Road was http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion. (And if you\u2019re still a little behind the curve on what the whole deal was with Silk Road, it\u2019s worth reading Adrian Chen\u2019s piece about it for Kotaku.com from 2011 .) So I went looking around to see what I could find on the Dark Web. My first stop was a site called TorLinks that is a list of sites operating in the .onion domain space. There I found links for what appeared to be a bit of a seedy and primitive underbelly of the Internet. But at the same time, when you look at them, it\u2019s hard not to imagine that the whole thing is some kind of put-on. Topping the list were \u201cfinancial services,\u201d or sites advertising services related to Bitcoin , the untraceable digital currency that is apparently the coin of the realm in this corner of the Internet. I also found working links to two sites offering counterfeit currency: One offered $5,000 worth of fake American $50 bills for the Bitcoin equivalent of $2,000; another offered 6,000 fake euro notes in 50 euro denominations for 1,900 euro worth of Bitcoin. There\u2019s also a \u201cservices\u201d section. One site advertises a \u201crent-a-hacker\u201d service. Another sells fake passports and ID cards. It turns out that Ross Ulbricht, the 29-year-old San Francisco man whom the FBI arrested for operating the Silk Road site, had attracted the attention of the Department of Homeland Security when he ordered a bunch of fake IDs delivered to his home. There\u2019s even a site offering contract killings in the U.S., Canada and the European Union. The going rate: $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in the U.S. and Canada, $12,000 in Europe. And yes, it totally looked like a put-on. But then, what do I know? You\u2019ll just have to find out for yourselves, but you can probably imagine what\u2019s there: Guns, ammo, drugs, porn, stolen credit card numbers, etc. There are links to numerous message forums dedicated to revolutionary politics and wacky conspiracy theories. You get the idea. It reminded me of the early 1990s-era Internet, before the Web itself was mainstream, but not in a good way. There\u2019s also a search engine called Torch that claims to have indexed 117,367 pages in the .onion space. Some searches I did worked, some timed out. Again, your mileage may vary. After a couple hours of exploration I got thoroughly bored. You probably will, too.

Ross William Ulbricht ordered the hit against an employee who took delivery of a kilogram of cocaine valued at $27,000, according to a superseding indictment filed in federal court in Maryland . Shortly after receipt, the employee came under suspicion of stealing from other Silk Road members after he was arrested by law enforcement authorities, prosecutors said. Communicating with an undercover law enforcement agent posing as a drug smuggler, Dread Pirate Roberts\u2014the online moniker prosecutors say Ulbricht used as leader of Silk Road\u2014first asked that the suspected employee be beaten and forced to return the stolen Bitcoins. Soon, the indictment alleged, the kingpin changed his mind. \"Can you change the order to execute rather than torture?\" Ulbricht allegedly asked in January. The employee\u2014who prosecutors said had access to private messages sent by all Silk Road users including its boss\u2014\"was on the inside for a while, and now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info.\" Dread Pirate Roberts, who agreed to pay $40,000 in advance and another $40,000 when the hit was completed, said that he had \"never killed before, but it is the right move in this case,\" the indictment added. On February 4, Dread Pirate Roberts allegedly transferred $40,000 into a bank account controlled by the undercover agent. On March 1, Dread Pirate Roberts had the remainder deposited into the account after he received a staged photo that purported to depict the body of the employee who had died of asphyxiation and heart rupture after being tortured. \"I'm pissed I had to kill him ... but what's done is done,\" Dread Pirate Roberts allegedly wrote after receiving the image. \"I just can't believe he was so stupid. I just wish more people had some integrity.\" \u201cThis kind of behavior is unforgivable to me\u201d The indictment isn't the first court document to level chilling murder-for-hire allegations against Ulbricht. A separate 39-page criminal complaint claims that two months later Ulbricht ordered a $150,000 hit on a Silk Road user known as FriendlyChemist. The murder was ordered after FriendlyChemist hacked into the computer of a large Silk Road drug dealer and provided Ulbricht with a sample of usernames, addresses, and order information to prove it. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the data unless he was paid $500,000. \"This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me,\" Ulbricht told a Silk Road user named redandwhite, according to the complaint. \"Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.\" Referring to the hit, he went on to say \"it doesn't have to be clean.\" There is no evidence the hit was ever carried out. Authorities in White Rock, British Columbia, where Dread Pirate Roberts said FriendlyChemist lived with a wife and three children, have no record of a homicide occurring on March 31, the date redandwhite told Dread Pirate Roberts the man was executed. Ulbricht is scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. He has not entered a plea or commented on the allegations.", "lede": "The Silk Road bust View all\u2026 The kingpin of the Silk Road drug em...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/feds-silkroad-boss-paid-80000-for-snitchs-murder-and-torture/"}, {"author": "Robert McMillan", "title": "The Silk Road Is Dead. But Bitcoin Lives On", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:30:00", "content": "Two years ago, Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchin sent a message to Attorney General Eric Holder and the head of the Drug Enforcement Agency: Shut down the Silk Road, they said. Concerned by reports about a wide-open marketplace operating as a kind of stoner\u2019s Amazon, the two senators demanded action. The Silk Road kept chugging along, but the senators\u2019 June 8, 2011 letter had an immediate effect somewhere else: in the world of Bitcoin, the digital currency that helps drive the Silk Road. Bitcoin prices promptly went over a cliff, dropping by two-thirds over the next three days. And they kept drifting downwards for months after that. The plunge seemed to confirm that the fates of the Silk Road and Bitcoin were intertwined. Nobody really knew how big a part of the Bitcoin economy the Silk Road really played. But then the feds shuttered the Silk Road this past Wednesday, and now it\u2019s pretty clear, thanks to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Christopher Tarbell, the special agent who signed the complaint against alleged Silk Road mastermind, Ross Ulbricht. From February 2011 to July 2013, there were 1.2 million transactions on the site, accounting for 9.5 million bitcoins. That\u2019s about 4 percent of the 225 million bitcoin transactions that happened on Bitcoin\u2019s public block chain over the same period. The marketplace connected about 150,000 buyer accounts with just under 4,000 sellers. That means that the Silk Road was a very big player in the Bitcoin world, but maybe not the giant that some suspected it was . The relationship between Bitcoin and Ulbricht is clearer too, thanks to court documents that depict Ulbricht as a fan of Austrian Economic Theory and serious Bitcoin trader. According to prosecutors, Ulbricht was \u201cAltoid,\u2019 a frequent poster to Bitcoin forums. Altoid often boasted about buying low and selling high in Bitcoin exchanges. And when Silk Road launched, bitcoin was its only method of payment. Since that time, legitimate bitcoin use has grown, and the bitcoin economy has diversified. There\u2019s still a lot of gambling and speculation. But now you can buy groceries or electronics or cupcakes, or even pay for a cab with bitcoins Although bitcoin took a big drop on the news of the Silk Road bust this Wednesday, it bounced back pretty quickly. So while bitcoins were down 66 percent two years ago on the mere mention of a Silk Road closure, when the F.B.I. finally came knocking, it only bashed the digital currency by about 7 percent. That\u2019s not much worse than a typical day for bitcoin, which has moved about 2.7 percent per day, on average, since it had its big run-up this past spring, according to data compiled by Bitcoin analysis site, The Genesis Block, which has posted an interesting analysis of the relationship between bitcoin and the Silk Road . \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is there\u2019s a huge shift towards this legitimate economy,\u201d says Greg Schvey the Genesis Block\u2019s head of research. In fact, the feds would probably have had a harder time investigating the Silk Road if it had been a cash-based network, says Patrick Murck, a lawyer for the Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit group that is working to steer bitcoin into the mainstream. \u201cIt highlights some things that we\u2019ve been saying all along,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t this magical anonymous currency that helps people with illegal activity.\u201d", "lede": "Two years ago, Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchi...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/10/silk_road/"}]}, {"cluster": 1, "articles": [{"author": "None", "title": "Yahoo, Singapore Press Holdings Settle Copyright Suit", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-01 03:12:23", "content": "Answers allows you to tap the knowledge of Community members.

GoPro's New Cameras Are Smaller, Speedier", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 20:09:00", "content": "Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc GoPro didn\u2019t need to radically reinvent its Hero cameras to maintain top-dog status at the summit of action-camera mountain. And so it didn\u2019t. The new GoPro Hero3+ cameras add a few improvements to the already-excellent Hero3 lineup, and although the changes are conservative, they\u2019re welcome. The new Hero3+ lineup is smaller, lighter, and has a longer-lasting battery than last year\u2019s Hero3. In short: The new Hero3+ lineup is smaller (GoPro says 20 percent smaller, but there are no dimensions listed on the company\u2019s site), lighter (20 percent is quoted again, but the Hero3+ has the same 2.6 oz. weight listed as its predecessor), and has a longer-lasting battery than last year\u2019s Hero3. GoPro says the camera\u2019s battery life has been increased by 30 percent, which would put it at about 1.5 to 2 hours per charge instead of 1 to 1.5 hours. Functionally, there\u2019s not a lot different. That\u2019s largely a good thing. Built-in Wi-Fi is included in all the new models, and the highest-end Black Edition comes bundled with its own remote. According to the company, interaction with the GoPro mobile app and streaming video to devices are speedier with the new cameras too. Other than that, they have the same respectable F2.8 aperture and fixed focal length as the last generation, but GoPro is touting the enhanced sharpness of the new optics. The Black Edition cameras also boast a mode that automatically optimizes exposure in low-light situations. And, of course, the cameras are still practically everything-proof: They\u2019re waterproof down to 131 feet, and they can handle being pilloried by waves and bears . Like its predecessor, the highest-end Hero3+ Black Edition shoots 4K video footage (3840 x 2160), but that feature isn\u2019t as exciting as it sounds. A maximum capture rate of 15 frames per second essentially makes the 4K moot; video may look more detailed, but 15fps is choppy as hell. It\u2019s a head-scratching limitation as the Hero3+ Black Edition can shoot 12-megapixel stills at 30fps. If 4K footage is basically a string of 8-megapixel stills strung together, shouldn\u2019t 4K at 30fps be achievable with the same camera? I\u2019m no scientist, but it seems like it. Much more exciting is the fact that in plain old 1080p mode, the Hero 3+ lineup captures at a smooth 60fps. That\u2019s not exactly new either \u2014 the Hero3 Black Edition did that as well. All the Hero3+ models also record high-speed/super-slow-motion 720p video at 120fps and 640 x 480 resolution video at 240fps. There are three variations in the new GoPro Hero3+ lineup. The Hero3+ Black Edition ($400) is the flagship model, with a 12-megapixel sensor, 4K video capture capabilities, the new low-light mode, and a remote. The identically priced Hero3+ Black Edition Surf is the same camera with surf mounts included. And the Hero3+ Silver Edition drops the price down to $300, but it has a lower-resolution 10-megapixel sensor, a slower burst mode that tops out at 10fps, and it lacks the 4K video mode and bundled remote.", "lede": "Image courtesy of GoPro/Woodman Labs, Inc Image courtesy of GoPro...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/10/new-gopro-cameras/"}]}, {"cluster": 2, "articles": [{"author": "Ina Fried", "title": "Facebook Tries to Make Its Home More Inviting by Welcoming Photos From Other Services", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:00:06", "content": "Aiming to make its mobile environment more attractive to Android users, Facebook announced on Thursday that it will start allowing Facebook Home users to see photos and posts from Flickr, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram from their lock screen.

Facebook Facebook revealed plans Wednesday to build a $120 million, 394-unit housing community near its Menlo Park, California, offices. The development, named Anton Menlo, will in part address the housing shortage in the area\u2014employees often inquire about where they should live, according to\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal \u2014but it will also operate as a semi-self-contained community with a number of amenities, among them a very short commute time to work. All but 15 of the apartments will be open to non-Facebook employees, and Facebook is retiring about the community\u2019s prospects as a perk for employees. But the company worked with a San Francisco developer to ape the style of Facebook\u2019s own headquarters in Menlo Park so that, in theory, employees would have a seamless transition between the \u201chome\u201d of work and the \u201chome\u201d of home. Aside from apartments, the area will include a convenience store, sports pub, bike repair shop, yoga studio, pool, cafe, and doggy daycare services. Construction is expected to take at least two years. As the WSJ points out, the community echoes the concept of company towns that had a brief surge of popularity around the start of the twentieth\u00a0century. Business moguls like George Pullman and Andrew Carnegie constructed fully realized towns for their working-class employees to live in, collecting them all in the same place and keeping them convenient to their work sites. Company towns tended to be isolated from other social communities, and workers outside of them would be isolated from each other. Inside the towns there were social events, schools, and even hospitals. But with the convenience came added social pressure : the company towns were a breeding ground for middle-class values\u2014house ownership and families in a close-knit community\u2014that compelled the employees to stay put. Facebook employees are unlikely to be as prone to feeling a need to move up in the world the way steel workers living in Carnegie\u2019s company town might have. The Facebook employee\u2019s burden is more likely to be a home life built to mirror a work life, among colleagues, that extends a long work day even further. And Anton Menlo seems better suited to housing young engineers than families, with only a handful of three-bedroom apartments. Over half of the residences are one-bedrooms. Corporate housing is not an unfamiliar concept for large companies, especially tech companies. Employers like Microsoft and Amazon often provide housing options for their interns and temporary placements for employees who are in town or migrating to the area. But Facebook\u2019s move to provide its employees with a permanent, community-focused housing solution is unusual. Still, big tech companies often become part of the landscape without the company having to build itself apartments. And Facebook's future apartments won't even accommodate that many of the Menlo Park employees, only 10 percent or so. But company housing is a concept that is not really \"done\u201d anymore; the closest modern analogy might be the Foxconn and Pegatron dorms,\u00a0 infamous for housing the factory workers who make Apple products in less-than-desirable conditions, or the Olympic Village that puts up athletes while the games are on. And Facebook's apartments might encourage more of the mixing Steve Jobs targeted when he proposed only two bathrooms for Pixar\u2019s campus. If employees hanging out in luxury common areas with beer and frozen yogurt on the Facebook campus proper are generating good ideas, perhaps half-asleep employees crossing paths while taking the trash out in their pajamas will generate even better ones.", "lede": "A rendering of Anton Menlo, the apartments Facebook plans to buil...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/10/the-houses-that-facebook-built-are-coming-to-san-francisco/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Facebook's Company Town", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:41:10", "content": "Facebook Inc.'s sprawling campus in Menlo Park, Calif., is so full of cushy perks that some employees may never want to go home. Soon, they'll have that option. The social network said this week it is working with a local developer to build a $120 million, 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices. Called Anton Menlo, the 630,000 square-foot rental property will include everything from a sports bar to a doggy day care. Facebook Inc.'s sprawling campus in Menlo Park, Calif., is so full of cushy perks that some employees may never want to go home. Soon, they'll have that option. Reed Albergotti has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Facebook Even in Silicon Valley, where tech companies compete to lure coveted engineers with over-the-top perks and offices that resemble adult playgrounds, Facebook's plan breaks new ground. A Facebook spokeswoman said employee retention wasn't a major factor in the real estate push. \"We're certainly excited to have more housing options closer to campus, but we believe that people work at Facebook because what they do is rewarding and they believe in our mission,\" she said. The Facebook Life Amenities for residents of an apartment building Facebook is constructing near its campus: On-site cafe, convenience store, and sports pub Bicycle repair shop with onsite storage Pet spa with doggy day care, pet walking services, dog park Resort-inspired pool, spa and cabana area Indoor/outdoor wellness, yoga and training facility with personal training Rooftop entertainment deck with three-themed areas Some employees had inquired about places to live near the corporate campus, she said, amid a housing shortage in Menlo Park. Real estate prices are skyrocketing in Silicon Valley, and in San Francisco, up 24% in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the Bay Area, according to DataQuick , a real-estate data firm. The development conjures up memories of so-called \"company towns\" at the turn of the 20th century, where American factory workers lived in communities owned by their employer and were provided housing, health care, law enforcement, church and just about every other service necessary. Spending more time in the clutches of the company sphere isn't necessarily positive. One reason the old company towns eventually disappeared was that they could be overbearing to workers. In the 2013 version, the downside could be unspoken expectations that employees always be working. Facebook's plans are still a far cry from those steelworker and mining company towns from a century ago. Facebook employees aren't expected to work there for their entire lives. And the new development can only house a maximum of about 10% of its Menlo Park employees. But the move speaks to how competition is reshaping the role of corporate culture in the tech industry. \"Silicon Valley is in many ways the antithesis of the company town,\" said Ajay Agrawal, a professor of entrepreneurship at University of Toronto. In today's tech industry, Mr. Agrawal says, employees feel less tied to a company, and more tied to the geographical location and industry. They're more likely to switch companies and collaborate on ideas with people outside their own corporation. One of the downsides of the Silicon Valley model, Mr. Agrawal says, is that if companies believe their employees will likely leave, they won't invest as much in their lives or their development. \"There may be some optimal level between the extreme company town,\" he says, \"and Silicon Valley, where everyone is moving companies.\" To build the housing, Facebook's \"amenities team\" worked with developer St. Anton Partners, a San Francisco Bay area, multi-family real estate developer, to create an environment that mirrors the atmosphere of its corporate campus, where employees are encouraged to mingle and share ideas. The apartments will go for market rates, and a handful will be set aside for low income residents. All but 15 of the units will be open to non-Facebook employees. \"The beauty of this thing is that it's extremely close to our campus,\" said John Tenanes, Facebook's director of real estate and an architect involved in the planning. \"It's a five-minute bike ride\" along a dedicated path that runs along the San Francisco bay, he said. \"You don't even have to put on the brakes.\" One of Facebook's corporate goals is to take care of as many aspects of its employees lives as possible. They don't have to worry about transportation\u2014there's a bus for that. Laundry and dry cleaning? Check. Hairstylists, woodworking classes, bike maintenance. Check. At Facebook, the company's headquarters are supposed to feel more like a college campus than an office. The 56-acre parcel, which it moved to in December 2011, will soon be connected to a new wing, designed by architect Frank Gehry. There is a winding asphalt road that runs through the center of campus where employees glide through on bicycles. Throughout the workday, programmers bond with advertising product developers over free lattes or ice cream, walking around the sculptures and shops, or lounging on sun-drenched grassy knolls and park benches. There is a company game day, where employees run the three-legged race. At night, employees watch movies on a giant, stadium-style outdoor television screen that looms over an open plaza in the middle of campus. Lauryn Hale, a Harvard Business School graduate who was hired by Facebook in 2010, said all the amenities take some stress out of the daily job and allow her to think more creatively. Her favorite thing to do is have a \"walking meeting\" with another employee, but only after grabbing a frozen yogurt at the sweet shop. \"I probably love that too much\" she says.

And, truth be told, the show wasn\u2019t that impressive \u2014 especially if you watched Facebook perform the same fiscal kabuki before it went public last year. It makes a lot of sense to compare Facebook and Twitter. Each company went through about eight years of life before going public \u2014 give or take six months \u2014 and each runs a fast-growing, Silicon Valley-based social network with a global footprint and a heavy dependence on advertising. But financially speaking, there\u2019s a massive gulf between them: One is a reliable profit gusher while the other is an anemic mess. First, credit where credit is due: Twitter is a growth machine. It tripled sales in 2012 and it more than tripled in 2011, and in most of the last six quarters, it grew its active user base by more than 10 percent. More than 65 percent of its advertising appears on mobile devices, a particularly important, fast-growing market. Revenue went from $28 million in 2010 to $317 million last year, giving Twitter significantly better revenue growth in the years leading up to its IPO than Facebook. The trouble is, losses are growing too. They grew to $69 million for the half-year ended June 30 versus $49 million in the same period last year, extending a streak that has seen Twitter lose money in every year of operation it has disclosed. Facebook, in contrast, posted steadily rocketing profits for the three years leading up its S-1. Then there are the absolute numbers, which make Twitter\u2019s little-bird mascot seem apt. By the time Facebook went public, it was posting $1 billion in annual profit on $3.7 billion in revenue from 845 million monthly users. So Twitter is less than one-tenth the company Facebook was when it went public, in terms of sales. It\u2019s less than one-third the company Facebook was in terms of users, claiming 218 million monthlies. And it\u2019s infinitely worse from a bottom-line perspective, since it\u2019s still losing money, $79 million last year. The silver lining there is that losses narrowed between 2011 and 2012. But sadly, they widened this year, by 41 percent in the first six months. It\u2019s also worth noting that Twitter\u2019s user growth is slowing, to 7 percent in the most recent quarter from roughly 10 to 11 percent in prior quarters. But in fairness to the Twitter: Facebook also saw monthly user growth decline in the last quarter contained in its own S-1 \u2014 though this was across a much larger user base. The trouble with Twitter, then, is that its growth seems to have been stunted. Seven and a half years after launch, it\u2019s not only still losing lots of money, but it\u2019s also a small fraction of the company Facebook was eight years after launch. This despite some big advantages, like free content from global mega-celebrities ranging from the presidents of the United States and Russia to stars like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey (to say nothing of Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga). Then there\u2019s the $1.1 billion in venture funding that has been lavished on the company at generous valuations. Twitter\u2019s arrested development makes sense when you consider it ran through three different CEOs while Facebook was run by just one. The optimistic interpretation of Twitter\u2019s much weaker growth story is that over the past three years, under CEO Dick Costolo, the company finally stopped screwing up and put itself on an excellent trajectory that is bound to continue given Twitter\u2019s strong position in mobile and trove of frequently-updated celebrity content. But we\u2019ll find out in the next couple of months whether investors buy that story. Facebook was in a much stronger position \u2014 and its IPO didn\u2019t exactly go well.", "lede": "Twitter finally opened the kimono on Thursday, showing the world ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/twitter-pales-next-to-facebook/"}, {"author": "Cade Metz", "title": "As Twitter IPO Looms, Facebook Turns on Instagram Ads", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 22:04:00", "content": "Instagram will soon begin serving ads.

The movie will enter general release here in the US on October 4. It stars George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as two astronauts having what looks to be a really, really bad day in space. Trailers for the movie show them flying around in their space suits, yelling and crying and dodging debris from exploding satellites and space ships and space stations, all lit by a beautifully rendered and untouchably distant Earth in the background. The director and the studio have taken great pains to recreate the experience of operating in microgravity as accurately as possible. Cuar\u00f3n consulted with NASA astronauts on the particulars of moving in microgravity, and,\u00a0 according to the\u00a0 NY Daily News , the movie's production designers studied thousands of NASA photographs in order to make their vision of space look authentic. When asked how far that commitment to verisimilitude stretched, though, Cuar\u00f3n said that while the movie strives for accuracy, \"it would be disingenuous to say we did it 100 percent, because this is a movie, and we needed to take certain liberties.\" The five minute-plus extended trailer for Gravity . Keep this video handy, because we're going to give it the MST3k treatment in just a moment. There was a five-minute \"extended trailer\" for the movie published last month. It certainly had some gripping visuals, but the longer it went on, the deeper my frown became. I don't claim to be an expert, but the stuff that George Clooney and Sandra Bullock were doing on the screen just didn't look right. Certainly cool, but not right. But this is Ars, and on certain things, we have the hook up . I may not be the expert, but I knew someone who was, and I was going to ask for his official opinion on that extended trailer. The man who makes the plan The last time I talked with Zeb Scoville was at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab , the enormous indoor pool where NASA trains its astronauts on how to spacewalk\u2014or, more properly, how to function during extravehicular activity, or EVA. Scoville is the EVA task group lead at the NBL, and he is responsible for managing the teams that figure out how EVAs work. If an EVA's goal is to replace a part outside the space station, for example, Scoville figures out exactly what the astronauts need to do to replace the part, including the physical movements they need to make. His team is made up of actual NASA flight controllers\u2014during training at the pool, they run the simulations, and during the actual missions, they're manning the consoles in Mission Control. Enlarge / NASA EVA Task Group manager Zeb Scoville, standing in one of the test coordinator control rooms at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory . Visible behind him is the NBL pool. Steven Michael If anyone could shed some light on the accuracy or inaccuracy of Clooney and Bullock's space antics, I figured Scoville would be the man. After a quick call to NASA's press office to arrange some time to talk, we sat down together to watch our way through the trailer. Problem: debris The trailer kicks off with an EVA in progress, and a radio-distorted voice is heard calling for an abort. It becomes clear that the message is directed at some astronauts working on something outside their spacecraft. It looks like they're repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, though it might be something else\u2014for instance, some KEYHOLE reconnaissance satellites are said to share the Hubble's external form factor. Whatever it is, the astronauts are outside with big debris incoming, which means they're in trouble. Enlarge / Screencap from the trailer, showing the start of a giant debris storm. Note the monstrous size of the piece of debris near frame center. Warner Bros Right away, the sheer size of the debris gave us pause. NASA relies on US Strategic Command's big radars to keep constant radar watch on its vehicles, and the chunks shown on-screen are far larger than the minimum size that USSTRATCOM would notice. \"Part of the procedure for getting ready for an EVA would include checking for debris like this, wouldn't it?\" I asked. \"Right\u2014we have a process that's known as a 'certification of EVA readiness,'\" answered Scoville. \"We have the EVA community come together, and they'll present a lot of the technical analysis, and we give our community-wide consensus for a 'go' for the EVA.\" Scoville explained that this analysis includes an assessment of the risk of encountering orbital debris during the EVA. Space isn't empty, especially at the International Space Station's low altitude, and there's always the chance that there'll be a \"conjunction,\" NASA-speak for a potential collision between debris and a vehicle or astronaut. Debris risk is assessed in terms of the potential damage\u2014whether the expected amount of debris could cause a suit leak small enough to survive (which would terminate the mission), or whether it could cause loss of a spacecraft or even astronaut lives. \"The debris they have there is orders of magnitude larger than what you need to create a very catastrophic puncture in a space suit. For comparison, if you have up to about an eighth inch of a hole in an EMU\"\u2014that's Extravehicular Mobility Unit, NASA's acronym for a spacesuit\u2014\"it has emergency oxygen systems which can feed that leak and maintain pressure for about 30 minutes to get you back inside the airlock and repress the airlock. Above about an eighth of an inch, and it can't maintain pressure.\" \"Is there a procedure for what to do if that happens?\" I asked. \"Like, you stick your finger in the hole or try to squeeze the leak closed?\" Scoville responded in the negative because of the spacesuit's many-layered structure. \"On the inside, you have the bladder layer, that actually maintains the pressure of the suit. Beyond that there's the restraint layer, and then you have a neoprene layer, and beyond that the insulation mylar layers for heat rejection, with layers of scrim in between for separation, then the white Ortho-Fabric on the outside. No matter how much you squeeze or push on the outer layer, you're not getting to the inner layer where the bladder is. You wouldn't be able to seal that with a gloved hand with 4.3 pounds of pressure trying to get out of the suit.\" Although an EVA wouldn't be allowed to happen under such conditions, Scoville speaks up here and lets me know that he's actually Googled a plot summary of the movie in preparation for our talk. The debris in Gravity \u00a0actually comes from an event that occurs after the EVA has started. Under such circumstances, the EVA would indeed be terminated, just as is depicted in the trailer. I stow my nerd rage, and we continue. Problem: Clooney's jetpack After the debris zips past, intrepid astronaut George \"The Chin\" Clooney comes in frame, sporting a very cool space jetpack. There's a problem with that backpack, though\u2014nothing like it exists in NASA's active inventory anymore. To me, it looks like Clooney's character is supposed to be wearing a Manned Maneuvering Unit or MMU, a piece of equipment developed for shuttle astronauts to use while repairing satellites. The MMUs worked great, but they weren't used very much, and NASA discontinued flying them in the 1990s. They weren't re-introduced for use on the International Space Station because they're too large and bulky. Enlarge / Clooney's fancy faux-MMU backpack sure does zip him around quick. Unfortunately, it's a wholly fictional piece of hardware. Warner Bros. I point this out to Scoville. \"Yeah,\" he replied. \"It looks not quite like a MMU, but it's something close to it. Those things, the manned maneuvering units, are no longer used. In some of those shots, it looks like a cross between a MMU and a thing we call SAFER , which stands for 'Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue,' which is similar to a MMU\u2014except it doesn't have the same level of redundancy, it's not as large, the joystick is a little different, and it doesn't hold as much gas.\" Enlarge / The SAFER backpack\u2014the closest operational real-world analog to the thing Clooney is wearing. The SAFER backpacks are for astronauts working around the International Space Station, and as the acronym suggests, they're intended to be used in case an astronaut accidentally drifts away from the station. Scoville explains that the little safety jetpack has 24 thrusters powered by the venting of compressed nitrogen gas, and it can accelerate an astronaut up to about 10 feet per second. The SAFER also has a smart gyro-based stabilization system that will automatically stop an astronaut from tumbling. However, these packs aren't intended to be used as the primary means for flitting about outside. The limited amount of delta-v the backpacks can impart is more than enough to stop a drifting astronaut, but the amount of propellant is very limited. SAFER backpacks weren't used on shuttle missions, either: \"On shuttle missions, when they weren't docked to station, they didn't need this\u2014they could just fly the shuttle after them to pick them up if they fell off.\" This provides one explanation for why Clooney's character is wearing a jetpack and Bullock's character isn't\u2014when we meet her in a moment, she's strapped into the foot restraints at the end of the space shuttle's remote manipulator arm, busily working away at repairing the telescope.

Just Go See Gravity</em>", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:30:00", "content": "During a particularly eye-popping scene in the astonishing new space thriller\u00a0 Gravity , I thought I saw my boyfriend, who was sitting next to me in the theater, yawn. For that fraction of a second, I questioned everything I knew about him, our relationship, and most damningly, his taste in movies. When I turned to look, however, I realized that his jaw was simply hanging open. It\u2019s a far more appropriate response to one of the most astonishing cinematic spectacles ever created. \u201cHow in the hell did they do that?\u201d we wondered, walking out of the theater later. This is the sort of movie that inspires those kinds of conversations, that kind of awe. And if you\u2019re the sort of movie viewer who would rather walk into an extremely memorable movie experience completely cold, then do yourself a favor: Stop reading now, buy a ticket to see the movie this weekend in 3-D (IMAX preferred), and get ready to have your mind blown. Minor spoilers for Gravity follow. The movie is a sort of minimalist mobile, hung over the crib of the Earth, with only three things dangling from it: astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer on her first mission in space; Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), a veteran rocket jockey; and \u2026 some other guy. (Technically his name is Shariff, but let\u2019s just say that he gets plucked off the mobile a little bit too early for it to really matter.) After a deadly debris field \u2014 damn those Russians! \u2014 catastrophically damages the satellite and cuts off all communication between the astronauts and Earth, we\u2019re left with two actors in a one-room play, albeit a room the size of the universe. The story is as small and personal as the setting is vast, and the movie\u2019s sense of space somehow captures those contradictions of scale: the agoraphobia of darkness extending infinitely in every direction, and the claustrophobia of being sealed inside tiny suits and shuttles that are the only insulation from instant death. Space, as the opening sequence of the movie reminds us, is a place where the temperature can vacillate between -260 to 150 degrees, where there is no oxygen, where there is no sound. In short, \u201clife is impossible.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment shared on multiple levels by Dr. Stone, a quiet, withdrawn woman who is difficult to love at the beginning of the movie, particularly compared to the jocular, talkative Kowalski, who jets around her like a kid on a zero-G rope swing, telling off-color stories about ex-wives and playing country music. It\u2019s not long before we learn the reason for her stoicism: She lost a daughter in a terrifyingly mundane accident \u2014 falling down on the playground \u2014 and has never quite recovered from it. Stone mentions there\u2019s no one who would mourn her if she didn\u2019t come back, and we get the sense that she detached from the world long before she started floating above it. It\u2019s hard to imagine a better metaphor for depression, or for grief: untethered and abandoned in a void so large that it boggles the mind , or simply shuts it down.\u00a0 You can tell, at times, that the idea of drifting away seems tempting to Stone, as if she could simply fall asleep in the infinite, inky snowbank of space. Much of the film is Stone\u2019s struggle, both literally and figuratively, between when to hold on to things and when to let them go. For her part,\u00a0Bullock acts the hell out of it, carrying almost the entire film on her shoulders in a transformative performance that seems destined for award nominations. The characters spend a lot of time talking to themselves \u2014 and to each other \u2014 to literally\u00a0fill the space, the way you turn on the TV in an empty house to feel like you\u2019re not alone. If there\u2019s any weakness in the film, it\u2019s the on-the-nose dialogue that sometimes emerges from these monologues, which end up simply telling us what the film has already shown us. Still, this thematic rib-poking doesn\u2019t meaningfully detract from either the film\u2019s emotional impact or its staggering visual grandeur. If ever there were a movie to see in 3-D, this is it. Where other 3-D films delight in shoving objects unexpectedly towards the viewer, here it\u2019s far more powerful to see them falling away. With no gravity to anchor them, every character is just one firm shove away from hurtling into space forever, with nothing to slow them down. There\u2019s a devastating long shot where something essential drifts away from Dr. Stone, receding from an image that fills the screen to a tiny speck. And in 3-D you feel every inch of the distance, growing slowly along with the sickening realization that it has been lost forever. The zero-G environment is remarkable, and the way characters move through it feels alternately weightless and heavy, like moving through liquid; we see the lithe Bullock glide through the portals of a space station with the grace of a swimmer, while outside in space cables and cords splay out as languid as seaweed before snapping back like whips. There\u2019s a breath and pulse to all of it, a rhythm that feels cyclical. Even the debris field \u2014 the primary antagonist, aside from the deadliness of space \u2014 has its own deadly orbit, reappearing to terrorize our heroes every 90 minutes as it hurtles its way around the earth. Be warned: For all its dazzling cinematography, this is a tense, anxious thriller; once it begins, there\u2019s little relief until the credits start rolling. If you have dreams later about Gravity , chances are they\u2019ll be nightmares about fumbling, endlessly and fruitlessly for handholds on spacecraft that you can never quite grasp before you tumble into nothingness. But rarely has that nightmare been so gorgeous to behold, or so unexpectedly life-affirming. I left the theater feeling like I\u2019d witnessed something so incredible that I wanted to tug on the sleeve of the person next to me and say, \u201cDid you see that?!\u201d If you\u2019d like to have an answer to that question when everyone is talking about Gravity come Monday, then I say to you again: Go buy a ticket. There are many things to say about this film, but the tl;dr version is this is a movie that demands to be beheld.

There\u2019s\u00a0 halted food safety inspections , kids with cancer who\u00a0 won\u2019t be able to join \u00a0clinical drug trials, and\u00a0 suspension of disease outbreak monitoring . Conservation studies have been thrown into disarray \u00a0and at least one NASA Mars mission is at risk of being delayed for years. But one area where the devastating effects aren\u2019t getting much public attention is basic biomedical research. What\u2019s happening to the thousands of researchers and billions of dollars dedicated to understanding human disease and development? I talked to a government biomedical scientist about the shutdown\u2019s effect. Because the scientist was instructed not to speak with the media, this person will remain anonymous. Below is an edited version of what the scientist told me. I\u2019m sitting here, the only person in the whole wing of this building, alone. The lights are off in my office. It\u2019s very depressing. It\u2019s very sad. I don\u2019t think the public realizes the devastating impact that this has on scientific research. Scientific research is not like turning on and off an assembly line. Experiments are frequently long-term and complicated. They involve specific treatments and specific times. You can\u2019t just stop and restart it. You\u2019ve probably just destroyed the experiment. You also can\u2019t necessarily recover. You can\u2019t begin an experiment all over again. If you do, you\u2019ll be set back months \u2014 if there\u2019s even time and personnel to do it. But often, science moves rapidly, times change, and you can\u2019t re-initiate the experiments. It\u2019s an enormous loss to scientific research, an enormous loss of time and personnel. Scientists are hardworking people. They work long hours, on weekends, and they do that because it\u2019s necessary. The schedules they follow aren\u2019t like an industrial plant\u2019s. If you interrupt them, they can\u2019t pick up and start again. It\u2019s an enormous waste of money and resources to interrupt this and have it abandoned. Unlike most other government medical researchers, this scientist has been allowed to visit the laboratory to feed rodents used in research by the scientist\u2019s group. Many if not most of the rodents will soon be euthanized. It\u2019s not a matter of feeding the animals and cleaning their cages. These animals used for research are used in intricate experiments, involving treatments and collection of data performed by hundreds of individual scientists with each project. An animal caretaker can\u2019t continue that. Given that, you can imagine what has to happen. You cannot maintain colonies for no reason. It\u2019s very expensive \u2014 and if they\u2019re useless for research, what are you going to do? And mice and rats breed like crazy. An exponential expansion of the population that will rapidly fill all the cages. Every lab I know already works to maximum capacity. You can\u2019t leave animals for somebody to feed and water. So every time a shutdown happens, measures have to be taken. The politicians might talk gloatingly about how they averted a shutdown five minutes to midnight, like the last one \u2014 but that\u2019s too late. The damage has already been done. All our preparations have to be done well in advance. As soon as you find out there\u2019s only going to be caretakers for the animals, the experiments have to end. We do our experiments 24/7 in my lab. You have to harvest at particular times. Experiments need to be processed and manipulated. A week\u2019s interruption would mean wasting and interrupting a lot of material \u2014 but what we\u2019re given is a shutdown of an indefinite period. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. We try to maintain as much life and resources as possible, but there\u2019s a lot that can\u2019t be maintained given an indefinite shutdown. While talking about the imminent death of the animals, remorse enters the scientist\u2019s voice. I\u2019m surprised: After all, the rodents are going to be killed during the experiments anyways, right? We only take the life of an animal if it\u2019s justified to provide new insight that will lead to basic understandings in science, or new treatments in human disease. We understand and appreciate that. We don\u2019t do it lightly. We do it deliberately. There\u2019s a difference between using an animal to obtain knowledge of human disease, and just having to engage in a mercy killing for no outcome, and with an enormous loss to science and to resources. It\u2019s a waste of money, a waste of time, a waste of people, a waste of animals. I ask if the scientist is being paid. I\u2019m not being paid. They\u2019ve promised to compensate me when this ends. Here I am in a dark building. I walk by the snack shop that this family runs, that everybody here in the building uses. They\u2019re an immigrant family, hardworking, they take the bus to work. They\u2019re here before anybody else and leave at the end of the day. Now that door is closed. That family is getting no money. They\u2019re not going to recover it. They\u2019re not going to be paid for the lost income. These are hardworking people that need the money. And it\u2019s all lost because of politicians engaging in this political terrorism. Democracy means that you\u2019re not always going to get your way. That\u2019s what democracy is. To apply a really loaded term \u2014 but I think it\u2019s appropriate \u2014 those engaged in this, I view theirs as anti-American behavior. It\u2019s ironic that factions with names like Tea Party and Patriot engage in anti-American behavior: shutting down the government because they don\u2019t agree with a vote passed by the majority. And I don\u2019t care what the issue is. We always have our right- and left-wing factions. Nobody ever gets their way. You can\u2019t sabotage the entire government in a democratic society and still have an America. What you end up with is a failed democracy.", "lede": "The federal shutdown\u2019s effects on science and medicine are many. ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/10/government-shutdown-affects-biomedical-research/"}, {"author": "Thomas Lin, Quanta Magazine", "title": "Big Data Is Too Big for Scientists to Handle Alone", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 14:30:00", "content": "Seven years ago, when David Schimel was asked to design an ambitious data project called the National Ecological Observatory Network , it was little more than a National Science Foundation grant. There was no formal organization, no employees, no detailed science plan. Emboldened by advances in remote sensing, data storage and computing power, NEON sought answers to the biggest question in ecology: How do global climate change, land use and biodiversity influence natural and managed ecosystems and the biosphere as a whole? \u201cWe don\u2019t understand that very well,\u201d Schimel said. Splitting his time at first between the new project and his role as a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , Schimel said he was surprised by the magnitude of the challenge, by the \u201csheer number of different measurements required to address the key science questions.\u201d Before any observatories could be erected or staff members hired, decisions had to be made about where to take measurements, what to measure, how to measure it and how to generate meaningful data. Schimel began to explore site options across the country and to assemble NASA-inspired \u201ctiger teams\u201d that could develop rigorous scientific methodologies and data-processing requirements. The final plan called for hiring dozens of scientists with disparate backgrounds; building more than 100 data-collection sites across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico; recording approximately 600 billion raw measurements per year for 30 years; and converting the raw data into more user-friendly \u201cdata products\u201d to be made freely available to scientists and the public. Building the observatory network is projected to take four more years and cost $434 million, and millions more will be needed to cover annual operating expenses. In 2007, Schimel became NEON\u2019s chief scientist and first full-time employee. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in processes at the continental scale for a long time and it\u2019s always been a data-starved activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opportunity to actually design a system to collect the right data at that scale was irresistible.\u201d Across the sciences, similar analyses of large-scale observational or experimental data, dubbed \u201cbig science,\u201d offer insights into many of the greatest mysteries. What is dark matter , and how is it distributed throughout the universe? Does life exist, or is it capable of existing on another planet? What are the connections between genetic markers and disease? How will the Earth\u2019s climate change over the next century and beyond? How do neural networks form thoughts, memories and consciousness? Much of the recent data frenzy \u2014 from the physical and life sciences to the user-generated content aggregated by Google, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 has come in the form of largely unstructured streams of digital potpourri that require new, flexible databases, massive computing power and sophisticated algorithms to wring out bits of meaning from them, said Matt LeMay, a former product manager at the URL shortening and bookmarking service Bitly. But \u201cbig data is not magic,\u201d he cautioned while teaching a database workshop this summer in Lower Manhattan. It doesn\u2019t matter how much data you have if you can\u2019t make sense of it. For projects like NEON, interpreting the data is a complicated business. Early on, the team realized that its data, while mid-size compared with the largest physics and biology projects, would be big in complexity. \u201cNEON\u2019s contribution to big data is not in its volume,\u201d said Steve Berukoff , the project\u2019s assistant director for data products. \u201cIt\u2019s in the heterogeneity and spatial and temporal distribution of data.\u201d Unlike the roughly 20 critical measurements in climate science or the vast but relatively structured data in particle physics, NEON will have more than 500 quantities to keep track of, from temperature, soil and water measurements to insect, bird, mammal and microbial samples to remote sensing and aerial imaging. Much of the data is highly unstructured and difficult to parse \u2014 for example, taxonomic names and behavioral observations, which are sometimes subject to debate and revision. And, as daunting as the looming data crush appears from a technical perspective, some of the greatest challenges are wholly nontechnical. Many researchers say the big science projects and analytical tools of the future can succeed only with the right mix of science, statistics, computer science, pure mathematics and deft leadership. In the big data age of distributed computing \u2014 in which enormously complex tasks are divided across a network of computers \u2014 the question remains: How should distributed science be conducted across a network of researchers? \u201cMachines are not going to organize data science research,\u201d said Bin Yu , a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, who works on high-dimensional data problems. \u201cHumans have to lead the way.\u201d But, she said, \u201cno one knows who is leading data science right now.\u201d Describing universities as \u201cvery siloed,\u201d Yu said the goal is not merely interdisciplinary research, but rather to reach a state of \u201ctransdisciplinary research,\u201d without walls or divisions. Big science projects \u201ccan\u2019t be dealt with by one person,\u201d said Jack Gilbert , an environmental microbiologist at Argonne National Laboratory who has helped NEON develop standards for analyzing soil samples and plans to utilize its data when it comes online. \u201cWe need to work together. It\u2019s too big a problem.\u201d Big \u2018Bad\u2019 Science Ecology has traditionally involved small, localized studies that examine how organisms interact with their surroundings. But in grappling with the foundational questions on a regional or global scale, the microsystems approach brings to mind the old Indian parable in which six blind men feel different parts of an elephant to determine its shape. In John Godfrey Saxe\u2019s popular retelling, the men come to wildly divergent conclusions, that the elephant is like a wall, spear, snake, tree, fan or rope. \u201cWe were missing key pieces of information and not getting the big picture,\u201d said Andrea Thorpe , 37, a plant ecologist who pursued smaller-scale studies on invasive species before joining NEON last year as its assistant director for terrestrial ecology. Although smaller studies provide much-needed depth and detail at a local level, they also tend to be limited to a specific set of questions and reflect an investigator\u2019s particular methodology, which can make results more difficult to reproduce or reconcile with broader models. \u2018There are some really big impacts happening to the ecosystem that can\u2019t be studied with short-term, smaller studies.\u2019 \u201cYou can\u2019t escape the fact that there are some really big impacts happening to the ecosystem that can\u2019t be studied with short-term, smaller studies,\u201d Thorpe said. Macrosystems, or \u201cbig,\u201d ecology, as Schimel calls it, becomes possible with standardized, broad-scale data. He says that having large, rich data sets enables scientists to incorporate the complexity and variability of the real world into their models of large-scale phenomena, rather than to \u201cpeanut butter over\u201d them with simplified models. Ecologists first delved into the world of big data about 50 years ago with the International Biological Program, which cut across scientific disciplines and involved dozens of countries in an attempt to model large-scale systems. It is beloved by the pioneers and supporters of international partnerships but was roundly criticized at the time by traditional biologists who were skeptical of big data modeling and titanic collaborations. Although the project paved the way for newer collaborative efforts like NEON, some of the criticisms have lingered. In 1969, Thomas Rosswall joined the Swedish tundra biome section of the IBP as a 28-year-old microbial ecologist. At a time when little coordinated research existed in biology, he said, the challenge was to get the microbiologists to work with the botanists and the hydrologists to work with the meteorologists. And the Cold War meant that outside scientists couldn\u2019t visit the Russian sites. Instead, the Russians shared pictures of their work. Rosswall, a former executive director of the International Council for Science who is now retired, said his IBP work shaped his career as an international scientist. The tundra project was a particularly close-knit community, he said. \u201cWe were also young and rather na\u00efve, and maybe that was good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have preconceived ideas on how things should be done.\u201d Pages: 1 2 View All", "lede": "Seven years ago, when David Schimel was asked to design an ambiti...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/10/big-data-science/"}]}, {"cluster": 5, "articles": [{"author": "Alex Williams", "title": "Cotap Launches Mobile Messaging Service For The Business World", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 05:20:41", "content": "Cotap Launches Mobile Messaging Service For The Business\u00a0World Cotap , a startup that\u00a0strives\u00a0to be the GroupMe of the business world, has launched its mobile\u00a0 messaging service designed for corporate customers. The service, available as an iPhone app and later on Android, allows users to invite people into managed, group conversations. It is similar to\u00a0GroupMe, the mobile messaging service that has become popular for texting with groups of people. With Cotap, a\u00a0customer invites one or more people who exchange messages via SMS or by email if they do not have an account.

Founded by Jim Patterson, Yammer\u2019s former chief product officer, the service\u00a0 employs a similar model to the enterprise social network that sold to\u00a0 Microsoft \u00a0for $1.2 billion. Cotap is free but requires a contract if the company wants to adopt the platform. The model obviously worked for Yammer, but it was confrontational. Yammer made it an all-or-nothing proposition: Pay up for control over the service or don\u2019t, and employees will continue to get access to the service with permission or not. Cotap wants to take a more conciliatory\u00a0approach to help IT see the value in the service. Patterson said its premium\u00a0features will include data export, data retention and monitoring. If a company doesn\u2019t buy, its users can continue to use the basic service for free, which is the same model as Yammer and Box. Patterson said Cotap will focus\u00a0more on selling value to companies rather than ownership of the data. \u201cLong term, we don\u2019t see\u00a0Cotap\u00a0as an IT tool, so our primary premium features won\u2019t be IT tools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the long-term value of\u00a0Cotap\u00a0being around employee engagement, which is the priority of C-level execs or HR.\u201d Launch Date: May 2013 Funding: $5.5M CoTap\u2019s mission is to help people work together better by simplifying mobile communication in the workplace.

Image: Dillenburger Architects Michael Hansmeyer and Benjamin Dillenburger are passionate about pushing the limits of 3-D design, and their latest algorithmically generated project, a room called Digital Grotesque , is composed of 260 million surfaces and 30 billion voxels, and takes up 78 gigabytes of hard drive space. Just rendering images of the stunningly detailed, 170-square-foot space took weeks, and when they searched for a 3-D printer that could produce their cavernous creation, none of the popular plastic printers could handle the load. CAD files in hand, the designer duo set out in search of a machine that could accommodate their architectural ambitions and found a solution in a 3-D printer typically used to manufacture engine blocks. Larger than most cars, Voxeljet\u2019s 3-D printers build models using silica sand and are capable of producing sandy sculptures that weigh up to 12 tons while maintaining a barely perceivable 0.13 millimeter layer thickness. These machines usually fabricate sand molds for investment casting. Their output is seen as a disposable byproduct, but Hansmeyer and Dillenburger coated the gritty components with a strengthening resin and treated them like giant sandstone bricks. \u201cThe limiting factor for us was no longer the dimensions of the printable space,\u201d says Hansmeyer, \u201cbut the logistics of transporting and assembling the pieces.\u201d It is an architecture that would otherwise be undrawable, and even inconceivable. It took a year for the designers to find the right tools and fabricating the building blocks took over a month, but the massive, 9-foot tall, industrial-strength sand castle was assembled in just under a day with the help of a gantry crane and team of volunteers. The physical results are stunning, but for Hansmeyer the design process is equally impressive and was an attempt to visualize the answer to a simple question: \u201cHow could an architecture that is entirely designed by algorithms look?\u201d Digital Grotesque looks like something that could have sprung from Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s drawing board, but the swirling, baroque shapes of the room are actually the results of a few simple equations, and Hansmeyer believes they \u201ccreate an architecture that would otherwise be undrawable, or even inconceivable using traditional means.\u201d Despite its procedural pedigree, Hansmeyer still claims authorship over the design. \u201cThe architect is still very much the designer, not the computer,\u201d he says, but the computational approach does change the creator\u2019s role. Software allows for dozens of potential solutions to emerge which can then be fed back into the system to create more potential designs, but leaves the real skill is in editing the results. \u201cThe architect becomes the cultivator and moderator of these production processes and forfeits direct control of some attributes to gain control over others.\u201d Digital Grotesque is an amazing proof of concept, but Hansmeyer has only laid the cornerstone of what could ultimately be a cathedral built to the glory of computational design. \u201cOne of the most astonishing things, and something we\u2019re still trying to get our head around, is that it costs the exact same amount to 3-D print a plain box as it does to print the most elaborate form conceivable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe costs are the same, and the amount of time required is the same. It is only the outside dimensions that matter, so there is no longer any cost for complexity and no cost for ornament.\u201d Digital Grosteque pushed the limits of laptops and 3-D printer, but the pair of architects have big plans to 3-D print a house with details as fine as grains of sand. \u201cIt will be a house that looks like nothing we can imagine today, and is just within reach!\u201d says Hansmeyer.", "lede": "Dramatic lighting helps catch the 170-square-foot structure's ext...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/design/2013/10/designers-build-industrial-strength-sand-castle-with-3-d-printer/"}]}, {"cluster": 6, "articles": [{"author": "Mark Gurman", "title": "Best Buy giving out $50 gift cards with iPhone 5c purchases through Oct. 7", "feed_title": "9to5Mac", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:45:36", "content": "Best Buy has noted on its website that between today (Thursday) and October 7th (next Monday), it will be offering $50 gift cards with iPhone 5c purchases.

London-based designers Shay Alkalay and Yael Mer run a studio together and are also the proud parents of a restless child who frequently demands bonus bedtime stories in the wee hours of the morning. One sleep deprived night, Mer was balancing his baby, holding a copy of Goodnight Moon , and using his iPhone as a flashlight when he got a bright idea\u2014turn the smartphone into a lightbulb and ensconce it in a little lamp to free up a hand and streamline story time. \u201cIt was a survival situation,\u201d jokes Mer. \u201cThe phone was next to me, I didn\u2019t have a bedside light, and it was hard to hold three things at once.\u201d Mer and Alkalay quickly started sketching up ideas for bedside lamps that would use smartphones as $600 LED lightbulbs. A list of requirements took shape quickly. They wanted a product that could accommodate many kinds of smartphones, a design with no electronics so their creation wouldn\u2019t become obsolete if a company switched up the connector, no specialized apps would be required, and most importantly, it needed to feel like furniture, not a gadget. Mer credits Pixar\u2019s animated lamp mascot as a partial inspiration. Mer credits Pixar\u2019s animated lamp mascot as a partial inspiration.

Mer and Alkalay sketched up a bevy of ideas, some functional and others that were purely fun. One concept was inspired by a slingshot and was intended to be a sculptural statement piece. Another solution used a rubber lampshade to do double duty and hold the phone while dispersing the light. A simple, upright design was inspired by traditional army flashlights and a lamp with a subtle rocking feature rounds out the collection. Plastics and metals are the default design choices for most smartphone accessories, but the designers decided to wrap their iPhones in warm, friendly materials like woods and rubber. \u201cWe designed the object to have character, to be something that will attract you,\u201d says Mer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this project if people didn\u2019t already sleep next to their phones. I\u2019m not crazy about this behavior, but if this is what people are already doing, we should design around it.\u201d The yellow rocking lamp ended up being the favorite of visitors of the London Design Festival where it attracted the attention of manufacturers.

Image: Talia Radford Yes, poking an ear works. Image: Talia Radford Photo booths always seem like a good idea. They\u2019re just sitting there in the corner of a dark, dank bar, waiting for you and four of your friends to cram yourselves into an impossibly tiny space. Most of the time you do because photo booths are fun! But then you realize there\u2019s no way in hell anyone is going to be able to reach the button to actually make the thing work. Photo booths are charming, sure. But they\u2019re also uncomfortable, archaic in their technology and half the time don\u2019t even print your photos. The Thermobooth, on the other hand, is a super smart version of photo booths past. With its geometrical, post-modern look, not only is it a beautiful object, it\u2019s also fail-proof. To make the Thermobooth work, all you need to do is touch the person next to you, and an electric charge triggers the flash, camera and printer. When two people touch skin to skin, the electrical circuit is closed. Designed by Talia Radford of Vienna-based taliaYstudio and artist Jonas Bohatsch , the Thermobooth replaces old photo booth technology with high-tech OLED lights, conductive plates and a thermal printer. The idea originated when Radford was looking for a way to make one of her studio parties more interactive. She called up Bohatsch, who has been working in the media art space for a while, and they hatched up a plan to create a 21st century photo booth. The original set up used at Radford\u2019s party was pretty rudimentary\u2014it was basically just a computer camera with a flash hanging off of it that was connected to a MaKey MaKey and thermal printer. \u201cIt was really ugly\u201d she recalls. But the concept was interesting. Interesting enough for lighting manufacturer OSRAM to help Radford and Bohatsch develop an upgraded version that uses OLED lights, the fancy new lighting technology used in expensive televisions. Radford\u2019s most recent design is more like a photo studio, with an open stage that\u2019s obscured by simple geometric mirrors rising from what Radford describes as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the set-up. These mirrors are actually OLED lights that act as both the flash and a way for users to check their mugs before the camera snaps. When you walk into the Thermobooth (shoes free) you step onto a carpet that has two circular plates. These discs are connected to the booth\u2019s brain through a MaKey MaKey and act as a break in the electrical circuit. So when two people touch skin to skin, the electrical circuit is closed, effectively turning participants into human-sized switch that powers the flash, camera and printer. It\u2019s a clever application of technology, plus it\u2019s a good excuse to take an adorable picture. The photo you get isn\u2019t the highest quality, but the choice to use a thermal printer instead of the glossy, high-tech variety was a deliberate choice. The Thermobooth, Radford says, is\u00a0about impulsiveness\u2014grabbing someone and kissing them, hugging them or even picking their nose (yes, that has happened). \u201cThe quality of the photos it\u2019s not really that great, but then we realized it\u2019s not really about the quality of the photos,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most important thing isn\u2019t the image, but what the image evokes.\u201d", "lede": "The Thermobooth only takes a photo when two people touch.

By comparing the iPhone 5S to an iPhone 5 and also to several real-world tools that the phone replicates with motion sensors (including an actual compass and a spirit level), Gizmodo found that the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer in two separate iPhone 5Ses do indeed appear to be off by a small but consistently measurable amount.

The relatively wide range of inaccuracies being reported and the fact that the iPhone 5 and 4S aren't affected point to this being a hardware issue and not a software issue, though without a statement for Apple it's difficult to say for sure. Beyond the inaccuracies in the compass app, the actual real-world impact of this issue is small. While Gizmodo's videos do show that the sensors can cause problems for games if you have the phone resting flat on a table, most people are going to subconsciously adjust the phone to compensate for the slight inaccuracies.

A couple years ago, Federici was working on his Ph.D. in biological sciences at Cambridge University studying self-organization, the process by which things organize themselves spontaneously and without direction. Like a flock of birds flying together . More specifically, he was using microscopes and a process called fluorescence microscopy to see if he could identify these kinds of patterns on a cellular level. In fluorescence microscopy, scientists shine a particular kind of light at whatever they\u2019re trying to illuminate and then that substance identifies itself by shining a different color or light back. Sometimes researchers will also attach proteins that they know emit a particular kind of light to substances as a kind of identifier. In the non-microscopic world, it\u2019s like using a black light on a stoner poster. Federici grew up with photography as a hobby, so looking through the microscope at all the different colors and patterns he realized that the process was highly visual. He hadn\u2019t seen many images like what he was seeing published for the general public, so he asked for permission from his adviser Jim Haseloff to post the photos on his Flickr site . Today that site is filled with pages and pages of microscopic images, some of which are from his work, while others are just for fun. \u201cMicroscopy is always serious science,\u201d says Federici, who is now a researcher at Pontificia Univerisdad Catolica de Chile. \u201cFor us [in the department at Cambridge] this was something we looked at as outreach. It was a way to bring this scientific data to the general public.\u201d Many of the photos on the site show particular bacteria colonies that were studied for their self-organizing principles. Others are just images of old plants that were used to teach botany at the university over a hundred years ago.

While most people have long since abandoned MS Paint as an outdated graphics application, Lasko has spent the last 13 years using the program to digitally create works of art, spending up to 10 hours a day on his work. Originally a traditional painter, he switched to MS Paint in 2005 when his vision was impaired by wet macular degeneration, an eye disease that causes blindness in the center of his vision. He has since created more than 150 digital works, though his blindness means he will never be able to view them in their totality. \u201cWhen I started to go blind, I wasn\u2019t able to get the brush quite where I wanted it,\u201d Lasko told WIRED. \u201cSo when I got into the art program on the computer, I appreciated that I could blow it up eight hundred times [larger] and be sure that I was hitting the right spot.\u201d Although he had never used computer graphics software before, Lasko did have experience with artistic design after working as a typographer. He mastered lettering as an apprentice after high school, creating fonts by hand, and learned to paint traditionally on his own. His grandson, Ryan Lasko, initially introduced him to Microsoft Paint, but according to Ryan, that too \u201cis all pretty much self-taught.\u201d Hal\u2019s work has been inspired by artists including Edward Hopper, Charles Burchfield, and Paul Clay; lately, he has come to appreciate impressionism, and experimented with ways to adapt its thin, layered brushstrokes with an 8-bit twist. While he initially didn\u2019t realize that his digital paintings could be printed, he now has a website selling 16\u201d x 20\u201d prints of eight different works; he may soon begin printing on canvas as well. Last July, Ryan, who works as a graphic designer for a New York City software company, teamed with Josh Bogdan, a college friend and San Francisco copywriter, to direct a short documentary called about Hal and his art. The Pixel Painter (above), which runs eight and a half minutes, spends an entire weekend with Hal discussing his love of making art in MS Paint; the shoot included his 97th birthday celebration and the debut of an art exhibit at a senior center where Hal displayed two of his digital paintings. \u201cHe\u2019ll talk to anyone for hours about his artwork,\u201d Bogdan said. \u201cIt\u2019s his passion. He loves to chat, and it takes nothing to get him going.\u201d Asked if he thinks about his paintings a lot, Hal laughed, \u201cthat\u2019s all I do.\u201d\u00a0He says he has \u201cenjoyed every minute\u201d of his work, including having his story told as a documentary. Since the video was posted on Vimeo last month, it has since tallied 1.2 million plays, reaching viewers in Poland, China, and South Korea. \u201cI was trying to explain things like Facebook and social media to him, but he still can\u2019t really believe it,\u201d Ryan Lasko said. \u201cThis worldwide scope is something he\u2019s still trying to wrap his head around.\u201d", "lede": "Hal Lasko may be 98 years old, but while many of his peers devote...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/pixel-painter-ms-paint/"}]}, {"cluster": 10, "articles": [{"author": "Jason Inofuentes", "title": "Intel powers an Arduino for the first time with new \u201cGalileo\u201d board", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 15:02:22", "content": "Intel At IDF last month, Intel previewed its latest small chip initiative, Quark. Slotting in well below the Atom line, much less Haswell, Quark is aimed at that old chestnut, \"the Internet of things.\" We were curious about when we'd see the first consumer Quark device, and it seems the time is now. At Maker Faire Rome today, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich introduced a collaboration between open source bastion Arduino and Intel's New Devices Group, and the first fruits of that collaboration are Galileo \u00a0(PDF). Typically driven by simple microcontrollers, basic Arduino boards are usually quite limited in connectivity, mainly USB and some Arduino-specific connectors. Expansion comes through those connectors, which allow daughterboards, called shields, to be layered atop the main board, adding additional I/O options. The ease of use\u2014and ease of expansion\u2014has long made the Arduino a favorite among the do-it-yourself crowd for things as simple as Christmas tree lights or as complex as a homebrewing robot. The Intel Galileo reference board isn't a basic board. The Quark SoC is quite potent for a device of this type, resembling a Pentium 3 more than a microcontroller. Though the legacy Arduino connectors remain for compatibility with shields, Galileo features connectivity through USB (host and client), 100Mbps Ethernet, microSD, RS-232, and a full-size mini-PCI Express slot. \"Intel Galileo features the Intel Quark SoC X1000, the first product from the Intel Quark technology family of low-power, small-core products,\" the company said. \"Intel Quark technology will extend Intel architecture into rapidly growing areas\u2014from the Internet of Things to wearable computing in the future.\" Intel will be donating 50,000 Galileo boards to universities around the world as part of the collaboration, and it will be available to hobbyists for $60 or less by November 29. That price makes Galileo quite competitive with existing Arduino boards, most of which aren't as feature complete. Intel promises full compatibility with Arduino software and existing hardware, which could make this a very attractive board for complex projects. Today's announcement continues Intel's attempts to target the DIY market dominated by Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, and Arduino. Intel recently teamed up with the maker of the BeagleBoard to create the \" Minnowboard ,\" a $199 computer powered by open hardware and software. Tiny computers have been run in large part by Intel's rival ARM lately. That's true of the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone Black . While Arduino traditionally used microcontrollers such as Atmel's, Arduino unveiled its first ARM-powered board one year ago with the Arduino DUE. Intel has boasted that its chips will provide more power, and, of course, compatibility with x86 applications.

I can line up carefully placed shots at the strange, red-colored humanoid enemies that populate SUPERHOT \u2018s five short levels. The game, available for free in browsers , is only a demo. A fully featured product is coming, SUPERHOT creative director Piotr Iwanicki tells WIRED \u2014 eventually. Since Iwanicki, from a city in Poland called \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (pronounced \u201cwoodge\u201d), put out the demo in mid-September, SUPERHOT has been slowly building an army of fans who are hungry for more than the small taste they\u2019ve been given. When Iwanicki put the game on Steam\u2019s Greenlight service, it got enough support to earn a slot on Steam in only five days \u2014 faster than any other game in Greenlight\u2019s short history. There\u2019s obvious promise shown in the free-to-play demo. One level has you running unarmed down a hallway while a small firing squad at the other end showers you with bullets. When you see them shoot, you can stop, figure out the trajectory of the bullets, and dive out of the way. It feels way too cool. Later, in a courtyard shootout, you\u2019ll discover how to pop around corners and set up frozen-in-time bullets aimed at multiple enemies. Then you\u2019ll duck behind a column, the very act of ducking sending the bullets on their way to their targets. Even if you take a full minute to decide a course of action and line up your shots, the events that unfold once you move will only occupy a moment in the flow of actual time. The end of the demo has a bizarre, government conspiracy feel to it, with a disembodied face forcing players to jump to their death out a window.

Flutter is a simple Windows and Mac OSX app that lets you control popular media players through a webcam. Just put your hand up to stop the media playback, or point your thumb right for \"next\" and left for \"previous.\" It seems that few people had heard of Flutter (yours truly included) until Google took the company under its wing, but luckily the app is still available for download, so we snagged it and gave it a quick test. The app works fantastically well, and hand gesture detection is near-instant. It works with iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, VLC, Keynote, Winamp, Windows Media Player, and, with a Chrome extension,\u00a0Youtube, Netflix, Pandora, and Grooveshark. Considering the length of that compatibility list, we suspect it's converting your hand signals into the standard media controls that adorn many keyboards. The homepage of the Flutter website has been replaced with the buyout message, but the original page is still up at\u00a0 https://flutterapp.com/home/ . Navneet Dalal, Flutter's CEO, wrote to the company's users today: When we started three years ago, our dream to build a ubiquitous and power-efficient gesture recognition technology was considered by many as just \"a dream,\" not a real possibility. Since then, we have strived to build the best machine vision algorithms and a delightful user experience. Even after we launched our first app, we didn\u2019t stop our research; your enthusiasm and support pushed us to continue to do better. We're inspired every day when we hear, for example, that Flutter makes you feel like a superhero\u2014because any sufficiently advanced technology should be indistinguishable from magic, right? Today, we are thrilled to announce that we will be continuing our research at Google. We share Google\u2019s passion for 10x thinking, and we\u2019re excited to add their rocket fuel to our journey. We\u2019d like to extend a special thank you to all of our users; your feedback and evangelism inspire us every day. Flutter users will be able to continue to use the app, and stay tuned for future updates. The next question is, what will Google do with a webcam gesture app? The most obvious choice is that it will integrate the functionality into Chromebooks\u00a0or Chrome itself. Flutter's hand gesture recognition could be a big differentiator and would keep the company a step ahead of the OEMs that are working to integrate Leap Motion's more\u00a0 frustrating hand gesture \u00a0technology. With zero extra hardware required, it's much cheaper than Leap technology, too. Using Flutter's capabilities in Android could be another path for Google. Currently, Samsung has a similar feature in its smartphones called \"Air Gesture,\" which lets you accept calls, switch music tracks, flip through pictures, and turn the screen on, all through gestures performed in front of the front-facing camera. If you're interested, you can try the latest edition to the Google Hivemind for yourself.

Flies were buzzing around the bloodied patch of earth outside a ransacked mosque in Tha Phyu Chai village where police removed Khin Naing's body after he was hacked to death by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists. \"He couldn't run fast enough from the Rakhine people,\" said his son, Tun Tun Naing, 17, who emerged from hiding to identify his father's corpse from what remained of his charred clothing. Khin Naing was one of five Muslims killed and four Rakhine Buddhists wounded in four days of violence in Thandwe, a township in western Rakhine State popular with foreign tourists for its nearby Ngapali Beach. Not far from its resorts, Buddhists armed with sticks, slingshots and machetes launched repeated attacks on Muslim villagers from Sunday, burning down dozens of homes, witnesses said. Sectarian violence in Myanmar has killed at least 240 people and displaced 140,000, most of them Muslims, since June 2012. The latest bloodshed in Thandwe shows Myanmar's reformist government struggling to curb the spread of a Buddhist nationalist movement known as 969 and control members of an ethnic Rakhine political party implicated in violence. The 969 movement is led by firebrand monks who preach that Islam is a threat and urge supporters to shun interfaith marriage and boycott Muslim-run businesses. The numbers symbolise the Buddha, his teachings and the monkhood. Many anti-Muslim attacks have taken place where monks have preached the 969 creed but the violence had ebbed in recent weeks until the Thandwe attacks. Police in Thandwe say they have arrested six people, including the local chairman of the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party (RNDP) and supporters of the 969 movement. RNDP members were implicated in anti-Muslim violence last October in which at least 89 people were killed, a Reuters investigation found. The latest violence coincided with a three-day visit to Rakhine State by President Thein Sein. Tension was high as he arrived in Thandwe on Wednesday, with police firing shots in the air to disperse a crowd. \"ENEMY BASES\" Evidence of 969 activity is hard to miss. Banners bearing the movement's logo flank roads to Ngapali beach. Muslims said 969 supporters had recently blasted Buddhist nationalistic songs from speakers at Thandwe town hall. That followed a sermon in Shwe Hlay village by a prominent 969 monk called Wirathu, who once described mosques as \"enemy bases\". \"After that, we had to be very careful in the village and not bump into Buddhists or make them angry,\" said Myint Aung, one of scores of Muslim residents of Tha Phyu Chai village huddled near one of the few homes left standing. Wirathu's admirers include Sann Sint, minister of religious affairs, who told Reuters in June the monk only promoted \"love and understanding between religions\". President Thein Sein has called Wirathu \"a son of Lord Buddha\" and said 969 \"is just a symbol of peace\". About five percent of Myanmar's 60 million people are Muslim, according to government estimates. About a million more are Rohingya Muslims, mostly stateless and living in northern Rakhine State. Maung Myint Htay, a Buddhist resident of Tha Phyu Chai, said he played no part in Tuesday's attacks, but didn't condemn them. \"It's not wrong,\" he said, adding that Rakhine people had a \"historical duty\" to protect their homeland from Muslims. Myint Moe of a group called the Committee for the Protection of Religion and Nationality acknowledged that he distributed 969 stickers and had the support of hundreds of Buddhist monks. Myint Moe rejected the name \"Rohingya\" and instead referred to members of that community as \"Bengalis\", a term that implies they are illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. An RNDP official in Thandwe said the arrest of party members could cause more unrest. \"It's the responsibility of the government because they arrested the party leader and religious leaders,\" said Maung Maung Phyu. \"People are angry.\" (Amends transliteration of name in paragraph three to Tun.)

Adobe dropped the bombshell revelation shortly after KrebsonSecurity's Brian Krebs reported that the hack began sometime in mid August and was carried out by the same criminals who breached LexisNexis and other major US data brokers. In the course of investigating the earlier intrusions, Krebs said he happened upon a 40 gigabyte trove of source code, much of it belonging to Adobe. Adobe confirmed its ColdFusion Web application software and its Acrobat document program were among those that were stolen. A new generation of exploits The Acrobat software family, which is intimately linked to the nearly ubiquitous Reader application, has long been a favorite target of malware developers looking for ways to sneak their malicious wares onto people's computers. The specter of hackers having full access to the raw source code of those applications is troubling, because it could make it easier to identify bugs that can be surreptitiously exploited in drive-by website attacks. \"This breach poses a serious concern to countless businesses and individuals,\" a statement issued by Holder Security , which assisted in Krebs's investigation, warned. \"While we are not aware of specific use of data from the source code, we fear that disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data. Effectively, this breach may have opened a gateway for a new generation of viruses, malware, and exploits.\" Adobe Chief Security Officer Brad Arkin said officials aren't aware of any unpatched vulnerabilities being targeted in any of the company's products. \"However, as always, we recommend customers run only supported versions of the software, apply all available security updates, and follow the advice of the Acrobat Enterprise Toolkit and the ColdFusion Lockdown Guide ,\" he added. He thanked Krebs and Alex Holden of Hold Security for their help in responding to the intrusion. Krebs said Adobe engineers are still in the process of checking on the integrity of its source code. The investigation includes looking for \"anomalous check-in activity on its code repositories,\" which could indicate the intruders were able to introduce backdoors or security bugs or otherwise tamper with the underlying applications. \"We are looking at malware analysis and exploring the different digital assets we have,\" Arkin told Krebs. \"Right now the investigation is really into the trail of breadcrumbs of where the bad guys touched.\" In an advisory , Arkin said attackers removed information for 2.9 million customers from company computers. That data included customer names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and other information relating to orders. Attackers also accessed customer IDs and \"encrypted\" (by which Adobe probably means cryptographically hashed) passwords. Customer passwords will be reset, and Arkin recommended customers change passwords on other sites if they matched those used in their Adobe accounts. Arkin said company employees have notified banks that process customer payments so they can work with payment card companies and card-issuing banks to protect customer accounts. Krebs said that one of the related intrusions he uncovered\u2014into the network of the National White Collar Crime Center\u2014appears to have been initiated by exploiting weaknesses in Adobe's ColdFusion product. While Adobe plugged all known security holes in the product a few months ago, many networks run outdated versions that expose the users to serious hacks. \"This indeed may have also been the vector that attackers used to infiltrate Adobe's own networks,\" Krebs said.", "lede": "Adobe said it suffered a sustained compromise of its corporate ne...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/adobe-source-code-and-customer-data-stolen-in-sustained-network-hack/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Hackers Hit Adobe Systems' Network", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 07:57:02", "content": "Answers allows you to tap the knowledge of Community members.

But for now, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda saw no need to ease policy further as Japan was on the path to escape deflation and, if international risks receded as hoped, government fiscal stimulus would further boost growth next year. The U.S. budget deadlock and fears of an unprecedented U.S. default dragged Tokyo shares to a four-week low and boosted the yen, casting a cloud on an otherwise upbeat outlook for Japan's export-driven economy. \"If this continues for a long time, this could destabilize financial markets and worsen sentiment,\" Kuroda told reporters after a two-day policy review meeting, adding that the BOJ was ready to respond to any sudden shocks. He declined to comment on the possibility of a U.S. debt default, but said the consequences of a prolonged standoff on global markets would be \"severe.\" \"We sincerely hope a solution is reached at an early date,\" Kuroda said. Through its massive holding of U.S. government debt, Japan is one America's biggest creditors. Other top international policymakers have also warned that a failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling before mid-month would be a serious blow to the world economy. As widely expected, the BOJ kept intact its intense monetary stimulus launched in April, under which it aims to double base money via asset purchases to meet its target of lifting inflation to 2 percent in roughly two years. EYES GDP REVISION UPGRADE On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would proceed with a planned increase in the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent next April, and cushion its impact with a 5 trillion yen ($51 billion) stimulus package. Kuroda said the tax rise was an important first step in reining in Japan's huge public debt which, at double the size of its $5 trillion economy, is the biggest among major industrialized nations. He also said the stimulus package would give a significant boost to growth, suggesting the central bank will revise up its long-term economic forecasts when they are released on October 31. The BOJ upgraded its assessment on capital expenditure to say it was picking up, adding strength to its view the economy was recovering moderately and suggesting that no additional monetary policy measures are needed to counter the impact of the sales tax increase. Japan's economy has now grown for three successive quarters as Abe's reflationary policies bolstered household spending and drove down the yen, benefiting exports, with annualized growth of 3.8 percent in April-June outpacing many G7 nations. The BOJ expects the sales tax hike to shave about 0.7 percentage point off growth, and estimates the economy will expand 1.3 percent in the business year beginning in April 2014. This already far outpaces the 0.7 percent growth projected in a recent Reuters poll, and its forecast does not factor in the effect of the government's stimulus package. \"I don't think the BOJ's view that the sales tax hike won't derail the recovery is too optimistic,\" said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities. \"But the 2 percent inflation remains a distant goal. Core consumer inflation could hit 1 percent early next year. But it's an uphill battle from there.\" Having launched its intense burst of stimulus in April, the BOJ does not want to act again easily. But it has not ruled out expanding stimulus if the damage from the tax hike proves bigger than expected and threatens the 2 percent inflation target. The big test will come in spring next year, and not just from the sales tax. By then there will also be more clarity on whether companies will raise wages enough to offset some of the pain households will feel from the tax hike, BOJ officials say.

The plans range from $218 ro $365 a month. One of the things they are offering to differentiate themselves against other health insurers is unlimited access to telemedicine. Clients should be able to call up doctors for any ailment at any time.\u00a0There is also free access to generic drugs on certain plans. Another thing they\u2019re doing is using natural language processing to match symptoms patients are reporting with appropriate doctors. So if a patient complains of chest pain, the system should route them to physicians who might have the matching expertise. Oscar is actually licensed as a health insurance operator in the state of New York, so it isn\u2019t some kind of front-end. This also gives it more power to be creative with the entire consumer experience. And the $40 million the company raised isn\u2019t actually all going toward operations.

A set of redefining technological trends is reshaping the landscape from a slow and cumbersome process practiced mainly by large enterprises to a much more flexible, agile process that mid-market companies as well as individuals can utilize. This report explores the key features that influence the evolution of agile BI and takes a look at the BI landscape under this light. At first glance, polarization seems to exist between traditional BI vendors, who are focused on extract, transform, and load (ETL) and reporting, and the newcomers, who are focused on data exploration and visualization, but a closer look reveals that, in fact, they converge as adoption of useful features is taking place across the spectrum. This report will illustrate for both the traditional BI vendors and the newcomers that: As the market is expanding, features such as cloud support and embedded domain-specific knowledge in BI solutions are key. Initially, the benefits will be more obvious to those smaller players who do not have the resources for in-house infrastructure and extended internal projects and who are driven more by needing immediate results. Over the long run, however, these features can benefit all types of organizations. Ubiquity and mobility are key features of data today; therefore, the ability to support a multitude of data sources with as little effort as possible \u2013 integrating them and accessing analysis results via a multitude of channels \u2013 is important in order to keep up.

It's also geared toward first-time smartphone owners with its simple interface and an $80 unlocked price. This combination of open, standards-based software and affordable hardware sounds like a dream for both developers and newcomers alike. But is that how it works in practice? Read our review and you'll find out. &#13; ZTE Open review &#13; See all photos &#13; 25 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; Hardware The design of the Open is an exercise in minimalism. A close cousin of the Android-based Kis III , it feels like a large, smooth pebble -- albeit one covered in soft-touch plastic. It's very comfortable to hold as a result, although the thin back cover and smudge-prone 3.5-inch screen will remind you that you're using a low-end handset. ZTE does deserve some kudos for embracing Firefox's native colors -- whether you buy an Open in blue or orange, your phone is destined to stand out. The back-to-basics philosophy extends to the controls and ports. Aside from the screen, the only features on the front are an LED (for charging only) and a capacitive home button. There's no front-facing camera, unfortunately. On the left is a volume rocker that's easy to use by feel alone; the top holds both a power button and a headphone jack, while the micro-USB port and microphone sit at the bottom. You'll find only a 2-megapixel camera and speaker on the back, although it's easy to pop off the rear cover and get access to both the 1,200mAh battery as well as the SIM and microSDHC card slots. That accessibility is essential, too, as the built-in 512MB of storage isn't enough to hold a media collection. The eBay version (available in the US and UK) doesn't ship with any microSD expansion, although carriers like Movistar Spain include a 4GB card in the box. As you've likely gathered, the Open will disappoint if you're looking for clever hardware tricks. There are no shortcut keys, notification lights or water resistance . About all you'll get for luxury is an FM radio. However, there's a refreshing simplicity to the design. It's tailor-made for newcomers to the smartphone world who don't need (or don't care for) any frills. While we wish that the components inside were more powerful, the form factor is at least appealing. ZTE Open Dimensions 114 x 62 x 12.5 mm (4.5 x 2.4 x 0.5 inches) Weight 120g (4.2 oz) Screen size 3.5 inches Screen resolution 480 x 320 Screen type TFT LCD Battery 1,200mAh lithium-ion (removable) Internal storage 512MB External storage MicroSDHC, up to 32GB Rear camera 2MP (fixed-focus) Front-facing cam None Video capture 352 x 288 NFC No Radios GSM GPRS / EDGE (850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900); HSDPA (850 / 1900) Bluetooth v2.1 SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM7225A CPU 1GHz single-core ARM Cortex-A5 GPU Adreno 200 RAM 256MB Entertainment None (USB mass storage for transfers) WiFi Dual-band, 802.11a/b/g/n Wireless Charging No Operating system Firefox OS 1.1 (1.0.1 on current units) Display Many smartphones under $100 have very basic displays, and that's exactly what you'll get with the Open. At 3.5 inches, the LCD is a bit too small for fast typing with Mozilla's on-screen keyboard. The 480 x 320 resolution is usable, but not exactly sharp. Colors are adequate (if flat) head-on, but they wash out when you view the phone from a sharp angle. The screen is at least readable in sunlight, though. To us, responsiveness is the display's main flaw. Despite using capacitive input, the Open's touchscreen just isn't very sensitive or accurate. It was too easy for us to miss a photo opportunity because our shutter press didn't register, or to launch an app when we meant to scroll. Even swiping down the notification bar requires a bit more effort than we're used to. The unresponsiveness is occasionally frustrating, and we'd expect better even at this modest price point. It wouldn't take much to get a significantly improved display, either. Contrast the Open with a more expensive (if still frugal) phone like the LG Optimus L3 II : LG may have shed some screen resolution, but its display is both more responsive and produces richer colors. While ZTE doesn't have to compete in the Optimus L3 II's price bracket, it should have spent more on the screen. Camera We'll be blunt: the Open's 2-megapixel rear camera is terrible, even by the standards of entry-level phone photography. Virtually every photo is full of blocky compression artifacts, noise and color inaccuracies. Well-lit photos in any environment are defined by purple fringing effects and blown-out highlights, while low-light images lose most of the visible detail. There's no flash to fill in that detail, and the fixed focus rules out any macro shots. We'd still take the Open's camera over none at all, but that's not exactly a compliment. &#13; ZTE Open sample shots &#13; See all photos &#13; 26 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; This isn't helped by the camera software, which is as rudimentary as it gets. Your options are to shoot photos, shoot videos or visit the gallery app -- and that's it. There are no settings or special modes. While there's a healthy selection of editing and sharing options in the gallery, such as cropping and exposure compensation, you'll have little input when taking the snapshot. Thankfully, Mozilla's Principal Developer Evangelist Christian Heilmann tells us that the basic feature set is due more to the hardware than the OS. We'd expect more advanced phones to get improved controls. Just be warned that video recording is equally crude, if not more so. You can only shoot 352 x 188, 20 fps movies with single-channel sound. The image quality is decent for the resolution, but the audio is worse than a phone call. We'd use the Open's video mode only as a last resort. Software This is why you're reading, really. The Open is the first taste of Firefox OS for many people, including programmers who want to test their Firefox OS apps on a real device. As such, a quick explanation of the platform is in order. At its heart, Firefox OS is a Linux variant that runs HTML5-based web apps instead of native code, even for hardware-dependent features like phone calls. Mozilla believes that its web focus liberates mobile app development ; by using open standards like HTML5, developers won't be locked into supporting just one device ecosystem. It could also make smartphones more affordable, as devices won't need to store apps that primarily run online. As Heilmann explains, it's meant to deliver a smartphone experience to those who'd otherwise buy a basic cellphone -- not to become the \"next iOS or Android.\" It may be a while before we get Firefox OS software that feels completely at home in the modern smartphone world. The basic experience will be familiar to anyone who has used iOS or Android, since it borrows a few concepts from both. Users get a basic home screen with a search box, a tray of customizable app shortcuts and an expandable notification bar with quick settings. Swiping to the right scrolls through your apps. Like iOS, almost every navigation element is onscreen; while that consumes extra space, it's potentially simpler for users who haven't tried (or just don't want) hardware keys. Ultimately, the interface is easy enough to understand that it takes just a few minutes to learn the ins and outs of the platform. That's no doubt the point. Mozilla wants even first-time smartphone owners to feel at home, and we'd say that the company succeeded. That simplicity extends to the search box, which epitomizes the web-based strategy of Firefox OS. Officially known as the adaptive app search field, the box shows web results as though they were apps, not pages. Look for sushi and you'll get icons for the likes of Epicurious (for sushi recipes) or Google Maps (to find nearby sushi places). Any relevant local apps appear in the list, and you can \"install\" any result as an app. The approach is simple and largely works, although it may be slightly confusing to users who won't always see an explanation of where a web link will go. Thankfully, they can always use the Firefox browser to see traditional, text-based web results. &#13; ZTE Open software photos &#13; See all photos &#13; 16 Photos &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; We have mixed reactions to this emphasis on web apps. The philosophy lets developers quickly port apps to Firefox OS, and lets phone makers include a lot of apps that aren't always available beyond major platforms. Our test unit shipped with third-party apps like AccuWeather, Facebook, Nokia's Here Maps , Twitter, Wikipedia and YouTube. However, this can be frustrating when you realize that most existing Firefox OS apps aren't much more capable than a mobile-optimized website. Here Maps can cache an area you're looking at for offline use, as it can elsewhere, but you can't jump over to Here Drive (like on Windows Phone) to get turn-by-turn navigation. Accordingly, you tend to lose major functionality present in native apps on other platforms, like most forms of push notifications and inter-app communication. Mozilla tells us that cross-app support is rolling out, and that app notifications will come in the OS' 1.2 upgrade; still, it may be a while before we get Firefox OS software that feels completely at home in the modern smartphone world. It's difficult to realize exactly what you're missing, as there aren't many apps in the Firefox Marketplace, Mozilla's official store. While that's somewhat forgivable given the web push and Firefox OS' limited market presence, it also leaves us hard-pressed to find the big-name apps that we like. Right now, many Firefox OS programs are filling holes left by better-known titles: Check-In Fox replaces Foursquare, for example, while Sketchbook Squad substitutes for Doodle Jump . We have noticed major releases like Pulse and SoundCloud , but they're in the minority. Discovery is limited to finding the newest or most popular apps in a given category. Although Firefox Marketplace will undoubtedly grow in the months ahead, it currently doesn't hold a candle to mature app portals like the App Store, Google Play or the Windows Phone Store. The OS itself is equally young. The Open unit we received is running a pre-release version of Firefox OS 1.1, which introduces surprisingly basic features like MMS and a search option in the music app. The phones on the market as of this writing are still using 1.0.1, and there's no word on whether or not they'll get 1.1 or later. Mozilla says that it can push security fixes itself -- an important advantage over some platforms -- but that bigger updates will usually require carrier or manufacturer approval. Regardless of the OS version, many of the stock apps include only the bare essentials. You can't put a video on repeat, for instance, and media syncing is limited to copying files in USB mass storage mode. Concepts like NFC and voice recognition just don't exist in Firefox OS at this stage, and there's no guarantee that they will, given the focus on low-cost, open technology. Firefox OS may be a great introduction to smartphones, but it's limiting for seasoned users. Performance and battery life Gauging the Open's performance is far trickier than it is with other devices. It's not just that we're looking at our first Firefox OS device, which prevents many direct comparisons; it's also that there are very few benchmarking tools. Still, there's enough here to give a clear indication of how well ZTE's handset deals with common tasks. Mozilla needs more capable hardware to demonstrate Firefox OS' potential. Getting around the OS is smooth enough. Although the Open is running on just a 1GHz, single-core Snapdragon MSM7225A and 256MB of RAM, the home screen, browser and many apps are mostly stutter-free. The hardware could keep up with a few 2D action games, too. Just don't expect a media powerhouse. We couldn't play H.264-encoded 720p video, and there aren't yet 3D games available (though WebGL makes these possible). More importantly, browsing -- Firefox OS' very reason for being -- falls a bit short. Everyday web surfing is fine, but more sophisticated pages and web apps either take a while to load or periodically bog down. That subjective experience is supported by our web benchmarking. The Open took 3,665ms to complete the SunSpider JavaScript test, or more than twice as long as the Lumia 520 (1,400ms). It's more comparable to the 2009-era Motorola Milestone , better known as the GSM equivalent to the Droid ; it wasn't much slower at 4,628ms. We tried other web tests to play it safe, and the results were less than flattering. Kraken, Mozilla's own JavaScript benchmark, took 67,371ms to complete where a Moto X we have on hand (admittedly, well beyond the Open's league) can finish that same test in 9,295ms. Google's Octane wouldn't even run on the Open -- it took several tries just to reach the page without an error, and the phone would invariably give up partway through. Cellular data is also an issue. We're not concerned about the Open's modest HSPA speeds, which on Canada's Telus network averaged about 3.1 Mbps for downloads and 1.3 Mbps for uploads. It's the reception that sours the experience. The Open is very sensitive to signal changes, and it's considerably more likely to drop its data link (at least in Ottawa) where other devices using the same 3G service work properly. When a phone that absolutely needs a good internet connection has trouble sustaining that connection, there's a serious problem. Battery life, on the other hand, is superb. Whatever gripes we might have with the basic software feature set, it keeps the Open running for a long time on a small lithium-ion pack. We couldn't run our usual looping video test, but it was easy to last through a day of moderate-to-heavy use that included several checks of both Facebook and Twitter, a similar amount of browsing, a 20-minute call, 20 photos and two short videos. Based on less-strenuous use after our formal testing, we could see the Open lasting for two or even three days without a fresh charge. Call quality is also good. In reasonably quiet situations, both ends of the call are loud and generally quite clear. There's no noise-canceling microphone, though, so you'll have to shout if you're in a loud environment. The rear speaker puts out sound at moderate volumes, and it isn't anything to write home about. Wrap-up We should reiterate what we said earlier in the review: the ZTE Open is partly intended as a developer phone. For those customers, it does the job well. You don't need a quad-core processor or a 1080p display to demonstrate that your HTML5 app runs properly. For $80 unlocked, the smartphone is even something of a bargain; it's cheap enough that you could buy several for a programming team. If you're looking for a testbed device, don't hesitate to pick one up. There are also certain everyday customers who might like the Open. If you're just considering a smartphone for the first time and object to the complexity or cost of what's on the market, it's hard to beat the pricing. On Movistar Spain, the Open costs \u20ac58 ($78) with prepaid service; the Optimus L3 II is twice as expensive, at \u20ac116 ($156). Travel to Colombia and the 149,900 pesos (also $78) that you'll pay at Movistar will easily undercut a phone like Samsung's Galaxy Young , which costs 317,900 pesos ($167). Mozilla argues that Firefox OS brings smartphones to a wider audience, and it's right -- some customers would be relegated to a basic feature phone if the Open weren't available. For many of you reading this, the Open won't make sense. The price differences between the Open and more advanced devices either won't matter as much, or aren't that large to start with. Americans will want to look at the Nokia Lumia 620 from Aio Wireless -- it's only slightly more expensive at $100 prepaid, but much more powerful. If you can spend $30 more beyond that, you may also want to consider a few Samsung phones, such as the Galaxy Amp (at Aio Wireless) and Galaxy Reverb (at Virgin Mobile). It's a tougher call if you're in Spain or another market where these deals aren't available, but we would investigate phones like the Optimus L3 II or Sony Xperia E . The Open is fine as a child's first phone or a backup device, however. Whether or not the Open fits your needs, one thing is clear: Mozilla needs more capable hardware to demonstrate Firefox OS' potential. The Open is good for someone whose alternative would be a basic flip phone, but the camera quality, connectivity, display and performance don't do full justice to the software. Thankfully, more smartphones are coming. Along with a more powerful ZTE phone , we can also expect the (unsanctioned) Geeksphone Peak+ . The as-yet-unannounced devices from Huawei and LG may also be worth waiting for. Firefox OS could easily take off -- it just needs a better launch vehicle. &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;", "lede": "&#13; As the first Firefox OS smartphone, the ZTE Open is an amba...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/zte-open-review/"}, {"author": "Richard Lawler", "title": "Google Glassware Review Process opens, gives devs a path to MyGlass listing", "feed_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:14:00", "content": "&#13; Developers eagerly working on services for the Google Glass headset finally have a clear avenue for release, now that the Glassware Review Process is ready.

Google says it will review\u00a0\u201daspects of design, usability, privacy, and security to ensure the quality of Glassware and the safety of our users.\u201d In a Google+ post , Google\u2019s Timothy Jordan explained the process while also announcing five additional new apps for Glass: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to announce that MyGlass now has new Glassware from SportsYapper, Fancy, Mashable, KitchMe and Thuuz. This Glassware was approved via the new Glassware Review Process that is now open to everyone with Glass. As of today, you can submit your Glassware for review. Completing the Glassware review process will make your Glassware eligible to show on MyGlass and eligible to receive quota beyond the testing limit. \u201c I\u2019ve been testing Google Glass of late and it\u2019s actually interesting how apps are installed. A main application called MyGlass is used to manage the Glass device: With it you can view what the Glass camera sees or set up connectivity.\u00a0Aside from device management, MyGlass acts like a mini app store for Glass. I just checked and the five new apps are already there; by selecting one or more, data from those apps will start appearing in Glass. So far, I find Glass very interesting from a wearable device perspective, but also limiting: It\u2019s great for specific Google services and a few others, however, the real potential will likely come from third-party apps.

This mobile app, called Circa News , doesn\u2019t give you articles. It gives you an endless stream of new information \u2014 the most important facts of the day, delivered as quickly as they arrive on the web. \u201cWe call it atomization,\u201d Galligan says. \u201cWe take a story, break it down into its core elements, and then tell that story over time.\u201d It\u2019s an intriguing crusade that seeks to reduce the time needed to digest the daily news \u2014 you can take in each new fact in between everything else you\u2019re doing on your phone, from checking email to posting pics on Facebook \u2014 and it only gets more interesting when Galligan mentions the rather unexpected place where he and his company drew their inspiration. They\u2019re reinventing news in the image of open source software code. Circa is yet another way that the very geeky world of programming is the way we do so many other things, from renovating houses to penning wedding invitations to writing laws . As it turns out, the way we build software code is also a great way to build just about anything. Galligan calls himself a serial entrepreneur, but he\u2019s also someone who has tried his hand at building software \u2014 at least on a small scale. More than a year ago, he teamed up with Ben Huh \u2014 the man whose Cheezburger blogging network reinvented online cat videos \u2014 to create a company that would overhaul the idea of online news. But the Circa app didn\u2019t really take shape until Galligan and a few tech-types got together and someone mentioned \u201cversion control.\u201d That\u2019s geek-speak for systems like GitHub , the widely popular online service that lets people collaborate on software projects. Anyone can add new code to a project through something called a \u201cpull request.\u201d They can instantly create a new project by \u201cforking\u201d an existing piece of code. And they can just as easily merge pieces of code together. What the Circa team realized is that they could treat news in much the same way. They could separate it into tiny pieces and use these pieces to build stories as time goes on. \u201cRather than write an article,\u201d says Galligan, \u201cwe decided to write stories as code gets written.\u201d Galligan employs a team of writers who distill a breaking story into a handful of key facts, and then, as the story develops, they can add new facts \u2014 or they can separate a key fact and use it as the basis for a new storyline. If the original story is the bombing of the Boston Marathon, for instance, it might branch into a separate story about the manhunt for the suspected bombers. \u201cNews works in this way,\u201d Galigan says. \u201cYou might work down one storyline for a while, but then it might fork .\u201d The metaphor then extends to everyone who uses the Circa mobile app. With the app, you can \u201cfollow\u201d stories in much the same way you follow someone posting to Twitter or, yes, follow software projects hosted on GitHub. If a story forks, you can then follow the fork too. Rather than reading articles, you\u2019re reading streams of news. \u201cI compare it to the Presidential Daily Brief,\u201d says Lane Wood, a longtime Circa user. \u201cYou get all the important information, and you get it really quickly and concisely \u2014 in a way that you can just easily consume it from your phone. You\u2019re in and you\u2019re out, and you\u2019re informed.\u201d Lane is currently following a story on the government shutdown. \u201cI could sift through Google News for a lot of long articles,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really, all I want to know is: Was there any progress made? What happened? Who said what? Those small, snippet updates are delivered to me, and I know exactly what\u2019s new.\u201d The app has been available for iPhone for more than a year, and today, Galligan and company released a version for Android phones as well. It now includes what Galligan calls \u201cnews alerts,\u201d which means the app will actively notify you when an important story has broken. With the click of an icon, you can then instantly follow that story as you would any other. Some may scoff at the idea of atomizing news in this way. But it\u2019s the way the world is moving. \u201cNews used to compete with news,\u201d says Galligan. \u201cBut now it competes with Angry Birds and Snapchat.\u201d For so many of us, Twitter itself has become a de facto news feed. We treat our world like an endless stream of tiny things \u2014 be they ideas or tasks or little bits of fun \u2014 and then, through machines, we collect and shape these things into something larger. We treat our world like software code.", "lede": "Matt Galligan is reinventing the way news works, ripping apart th...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/10/78301/"}]}, {"cluster": 16, "articles": [{"author": "Joe Mullin", "title": "Patent goliath Intellectual Ventures looks to raise another $3 billion", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 01:41:57", "content": "Patent-holding giant Intellectual Ventures (IV) has been making the rounds seeking investors for a new patent-purchasing fund, according to a Reuters report . The company is apparently out of money, having spent the $6 billion it has raised since its inception in 2000. For the time being, it has stopped buying new patents. According to the material IV gave to prospective investors, which were reviewed by Reuters, the company has achieved average return of 16.2 percent on the first patent fund it put together, in 2003. Its second fund, completed in 2008, has achieved an average of return of 2.5 percent. Those numbers seem somewhat questionable, though, in light of one of the few publicly available sources of IV returns. The\u00a0University of Texas Investment Management Company, or UTIMCO, was an early investor in IV and is required by law to disclose its annual returns. UTIMCO invested $50 million in IV's 2008 fund, but the value of its stake has decreased by about four percent, making it the fifth-worst investment that investment group made in 2008. UTIMCO's investment in one IV fund, the Invention Development Fund, has been a disastrous 70 percent loss. Several of the companies that once teamed up with IV on its first round of investment can surely be counted on not to join up this time. Google and Xilinx, for instance, both joined up with IV a decade ago when it had positioned itself as a kind of \"patent defense fund.\" After accepting their cash, IV has actually sued both Xilinx and Google (through its Motorola division) for patent infringement. Microsoft, an early IV backer which continues to have some ties to the patent-holding firm, told Reuters it has not invested in the new fund \"at this time.\" Intellectual Ventures was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft CTO. Intellectual Ventures refused to discuss the new fund-raising activity. For many years IV eschewed lawsuits, but it began filing them in 2010.

Obama had planned to depart on Saturday for a four-nation, week-long trip. He canceled visits to Malaysia and the Philippines earlier this week because of his budget struggle in the U.S. Congress and said late on Thursday he would not attend the regional summits in Indonesia and Brunei. The political standoff over the U.S. budget has shut down non-essential government services and appeared likely to drag on for another week or longer. Another crisis looms in two weeks when lawmakers must decide whether to increase the U.S. government's $16.7 trillion debt borrowing limit. \"The president made this decision based on the difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown, and his determination to continue pressing his case that Republicans should immediately allow a vote to reopen the government,\" the White House said. Obama was scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, among other leaders, at the summits. Two of his main aims would have been to discuss the Syria crisis with Putin and to hold talks on a maritime code of conduct for disputed territories in the oil- and gas-rich South China Sea. \"We are disappointed,\" said Indonesian Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring on the island of Bali, host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from Sunday. \"I think the summit will go on, there is a long-term plan. (But) without Obama, you can imagine how disappointed we are. We could hardly imagine he wouldn't come.\" Obama was also scheduled to attend the East Asia Summit, organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in Brunei next week. Xi, who was on a visit to Malaysia on Friday, did not comment on Obama's decision. But analysts said the no-show by the U.S. president would work to China's advantage. \"While his decision is perfectly understandable, it projects a poor image of America as a country that is politically dysfunctional and on the verge of another economic crisis,\" said Ian Storey, senior fellow at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. \"Meanwhile, cash-rich and self-confident China will have the floor to itself.\" Obama twice postponed visits to Indonesia and Australia in 2010, because of a health reform bill and then because of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. He was absent from the APEC meeting last year in Vladivostok, Russia because of a Democratic Party convention. SEVERE DILEMMA In Tokyo, Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said Abe would attend the summits as planned. \"This is a domestic problem of the United States,\" he said. \"We hope the (Obama) administration and Congress negotiate earnestly to solve the problem as early as possible, so that the problem won't be affecting various issues.\" Storey said the latest domestic crisis was posing a severe dilemma for Obama, since it clashed with a cherished foreign policy objective. At the APEC and East Asia Summits two years ago, Obama announced the U.S. strategic pivot, or rebalancing, toward Asia, which was seen as a reaction to the growing clout of China. \"On the one hand he needs to be in Asia to demonstrate America's commitment to the region and especially to the ASEAN-led regional security architecture that has been one of the central planks of his administration's Asia policy,\" said Storey. \"But with government employees on unpaid leave, Obama cannot afford to leave Washington and be seen hob-nobbing with world leaders on a tropical island.\" The Washington stalemate has idled hundreds of thousands of federal government workers and comes two weeks before Washington faces an even more crucial deadline - raising the U.S. debt limit so the United States can pay its bills. A bitter debate rages over that issue as well and if left unresolved could result in a U.S. debt default. Denis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific region, said not too much should be read into Obama's decision to call off the tour. \"I would read nothing more into the postponement of President Obama's trip than that he has to stay on and take care of this (crisis),\" he told reporters in Manila. \"I'm very confident that he will reschedule and frankly it will be a better visit if he's not on the phone having to call back home to get reports on the latest development there.\" Secretary of State John Kerry will lead delegations to both summits in place of Obama. Kerry will also go to Malaysia and the Philippines. Obama phoned both President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the Sultan of Brunei to inform them of his decision, the White House said. Obama looks forward to working with Asian allies and returning to the region at a later date, the White House said.

Because Google Now Eats Siri's Lunch", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:53:05", "content": "Apple has acquired the \u2018smart assistant\u2019 company Cue, for over $40M. Why? Because Google is absolutely murdering Apple when it comes to the utility of Google Now. Apple is likely to use the acquisition, or its talent, to bolster the offerings of its Today section with additional signals curated from email, social networks and more. This would improve the utility of the section, which is fairly sparse right now, and enable Apple to more vigorously compete with Google Now. Google\u2019s service already collates data from all of its services and networks, offering proactive information and assistance to users on Android (and in the iOS Search app). Siri and iOS 7\u2032s new Today section of the Notification Center simply don\u2019t compare to Google Now in-depth, usability or overall power. The ability of Google to tap into the deep array of contextual data that people have living in their Gmail inboxes and other Google products is being leveraged wonderfully by the Google Now team. I\u2019ve said before that Google Now can be considered reason enough to buy an Android phone, and I don\u2019t think Apple is blind to how good it is. With iOS 7, Apple introduced Today as a way to show you upcoming appointments, weather and basic directions to home or to work. This is sort of skimming the top of what is possible with the host of sensors your smartphone has available to it and the troves of data that you store in your inbox and other services. It doesn\u2019t dip into your Mail.app data, or provide information based on your location besides simple \u2018get there\u2019 directions.\u00a0 Google Now does all of that and a lot more, providing transit instructions and recommendations on timing if you\u2019re traveling. The card-based interface of Google Now offers a really compelling experience that only Google is churning through enough data to replicate. Apple ostensibly has similar data available to it, especially for heavy iCloud users, but it doesn\u2019t leverage it. There\u2019s just nothing on iOS that compares to the power of Google Now, including Siri and the Today feature. Much of that lies in Google Now\u2019s predictive nature. It doesn\u2019t just tell you what\u2019s going on now, it anticipates the information you might need and delivers it to you\u00a0 before you need it. The iOS version of the Google Now service is prevented from doing a lot of this because it has no deep access to the system. This is where things get interesting, as the Cue acquisition could be used to make Siri more powerful and aware, notifying you either via push notification or voice of things you may not even know you needed. The early arrival of a flight or train, congestion along your favorite route to work, and more. Push notifications are the future of how we communicate with our smart devices, whether they\u2019re pocketable or wearable. Making sure that any that Siri or Today might send are content rich and relevant is an important problem. The close integration of Siri as a responsive system and \u2018Today\u2019 as a proactive system could be greatly aided by the contextual information that was the core of Cue\u2019s feature set. Cue originally leveraged social accounts to provide an accurate picture of what things you had coming up and what you\u2019re going to do. Later in life it turned its attention primarily to email. The experience of the app itself was never \u2018amazing\u2019, per se, but they definitely their claws deep into email parsing and signaling. And that expertise could help beyond just Siri and Today as well, it could also give other apps like Calendar a contextual steroid shot. Rather than getting context-free dates and names there is potential here for Apple to offer a Calendar app that actually helps you get things done , rather than just remind you\u00a0 when\u00a0 things are due. Apps like Sunrise calendar and Donna are displaying what can be done with smartphone sensors and volunteered user data. That\u2019s just the beginning of what\u2019s possible if you own the bones of the OS. These kinds of acquisitions are exactly the kind that Apple likes to make. Small, talented teams that offer it the ability to either implement a new feature or augment an existing one. The proactive use of data in service of the user will be the defining feature of the next generation of smartphones. It will be interesting to see what the Cue team manages to get done.", "lede": "Apple has acquired the \u2018smart assistant\u2019 company Cue, for over $4...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/why-did-apple-buy-cue-because-google-now-eats-siris-lunch/"}, {"author": "Ina Fried", "title": "Apple Posts Fix for Mountain Lion Update That Caused Webcam Problems", "feed_title": "AllThingsD", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:51:53", "content": "Apple is releasing a software patch on Thursday designed to fix a problem with the latest Mac OS X update that caused the built-in camera in some recent Mac Book Air laptops to no longer function properly.

This source says that the operating system will reach Golden Master status internally by the end of this week or early next week, and it will be labeled as a build number in the high 13A590s or low 13A600s. This will be a slight increase over the current developer build that is version 13A584.\u00a0Earlier today, Apple seeded OS X Mavericks build 13A598 to members of its AppleSeed program, but it is unclear if that new version will ever reach developers. AppleSeed members believe that this build is a GM candidate, but a source says that Apple is already internally seeding newer builds.\u00a0The source has also corroborated our previous report by indicating that OS X Mavericks is currently scheduled to arrive on the Mac App Store within the last ten days of the month of October. Mavericks was supposed to reach GM status a few weeks ago, but critical bugs have kept pushing back the release, according to claims from sources. Since being announced at WWDC, OS X Mavericks is said to have picked up a few minor unannounced features. Namely, the Messages and FaceTime applications have received the ability to block phone numbers and Apple IDs from sending the Mavericks user messages and/or FaceTime calls. This addition brings parity to iOS 7 and the two operating systems will sync in this manner. While this enhancement is probably not surprising, it has not been present in any Mavericks Developer Preview to date. Mavericks will also bring the launch of iCloud Keychain\u2026 With OS X Mavericks nearing its public debut, and iOS 7 having arrived last month, Apple is said to already have diverted the majority of its OS X and iOS resources to development of the next two Apple operating systems: OS X 10.10 and iOS 8. Views to 9to5Mac from 10.10 began in September OS X 10.10 is internally codenamed Syrah (yes, another wine ), and sources hint that Apple has been toying with a new design across the system that is akin, but not as dramatically different, to the new designs found in iOS 7 and iCloud.com. As for iOS 8, development of that OS is making headway, and it will likely bring feature enhancements to Maps. Yesterday we reported that Apple has begun\u00a0 training its AppleCare support staff on OS X Mavericks. While OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 are not scheduled to be announced until next summer, users can expect a few updates in the near future (in addition to Mavericks): a new version of OS X 10.8.5 launched today , and we expect iOS 7.0.3 and iOS 7.1 to arrive by the end of the year. Apple also has several hardware releases still up its sleeve for this fall including multiple new iPads, Macs, and perhaps a fresh TV-related device .

Twitter says that along with things like monthly active users, ad revenue per timeline view is one of the key metrics it uses to evaluate its business. The company treats timeline views (\u201cthe total number of timelines requested when registered users visit Twitter, refresh a timeline or view search results while logged in on our website, mobile website or desktop or mobile applications\u201d) as a measure of user engagement, and it uses ad revenue per timeline view to track its ability to make money from that engagement. By that measure, Twitter\u2019s ability to monetize is improving. It says advertising revenue per timeline view was $0.80 for the three months ending on June 30 of this year, up 26 percent from the same period in 2012. That number is significantly higher in the United States ($2.17) compared to the rest of the world ($0.30), though the international number is up 111 percent year-over-year. Why invent an entirely new ad metric (and one without a handy acronym)? Well, Twitter has an unusual advertising model, with advertisers paying to promote tweets, trends, and accounts in users\u2019 news feeds, so the standard ad measurement of CPMs (the cost per thousand impressions) may not apply. The fact that \u201cadvertising revenue per timeline view\u201d actually measures revenue for every 1,000 timeline views suggests that this metric may be a proxy of sorts for CPMs. (It\u2019s probably a little dodgy to compare Twitter\u2019s numbers with traditional CPMs, but hey, just for fun \u2014 according to eMarketer, Facebook had an effective CPM of $.071 on mobile and $0.19 on desktop in 2012.) However, Twitter is really selling its ads as a way for companies to engage with consumers, so the filing also notes trends in cost per ad engagement \u2014 basically, it\u2019s been falling steadily, with a sequential decrease of 46 percent in the last quarter, 12 percent the quarter before that, and 19 percent the quarter before that. (A decline in cost means Twitter is getting paid less for each engagement.) The filing attributes these declines to an increase in ad inventory, which has been partially offset by growing demand. Advertising also gets its own section (page 18 if you want to read along) in the filing\u2019s discussion of various risk factors, where Twitter notes that all kinds of things could go wrong with its ad programs \u2014 for example, if Twitter is unable to convince brands to invest in building a presence on the service, or if new programs like its video-based Amplify ads don\u2019t take off, or if the decline in cost per engagement continues. As we wrote earlier , Twitter brought in $253 million in revenue in the first six months of the year. Of that amount, $221 million (87 percent) came from ads, compared to $32 million (13 percent) from data licensing. In comparison, the company made $7 million from advertising in all of 2010 (that\u2019s when it launched its first ad programs) and $21 million from data licensing. Oh, and Twitter says that mobile accounts for 65 percent of its ad revenue .", "lede": "If\u00a0you\u2019re reading Twitter\u2019s S-1 filing to see where the business ...", "link": "http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/twitter-ad-numbers/"}, {"author": "Alex Wilhelm", "title": "Twitter's International Revenue Is Skyrocketing, But The Company Is Worried About Sina Weibo And Line", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 23:12:47", "content": "Twitter\u2019s international revenue is up massively year over year, with the company earning more in the first half of 2013 from outside the United States than it did in all of 2012. Twitter\u2019s full-year 2012 international revenue totaled $53 million, while its first two quarters of 2013 saw $62.8 million in international incomes. According to its S-1 filing , Twitter has sold its \u201cPromoted Products\u201d services in more than 20 countries. That implies that Twitter is able to monetize its service in more than its home market. Users around the world are therefore valuable to the company, and not merely to its usage statistics. International revenue is a growing percentage of its top line, growing from 17 percent of total incomes in 2012, to 25 percent in the first half of 2013. This is healthy for the firm, underlining that it retain revenue growth potential despite becoming an established company. Twitter, like Facebook, generates much of its revenue from mobile usage of its social product. The company, however, is direct that while mobile is currently a strength for it, rival services that are also strong on mobile could slow its growth in usage and revenue. Here\u2019s Twitter\u2019s S-1 name-checking a number of services that could harm its growth: [I]ncreased competition from local websites, mobile applications and services that provide real-time communications, such as Sina Weibo in China, LINE in Japan and Kakao in South Korea, which have expanded and may continue to expand their geographic footprint; If those services were to expand to as many markets as Twitter, they could lower Twitter\u2019s usage, and therefore its ability to sell advertisements. Twitter plans on selling advertisements in more countries in the future it states, but if Line and its ilk slow its rollout, Twitter could find its revenue growth on hold. Twitter is already a mobile company , and it is quickly becoming an international firm. Given strong smartphone penetration in Asia, this is not surprising. But in the markets where it could see the most potential, Twitter will also face the stiffest winds.

One of the standard parts of the S-1 is a letter from the CEO to shareholders, where they lay out their vision for the company. In Twitter\u2019s filing, however, it\u2019s a letter from \u201c@Twitter\u201d. And whereas the letters from Groupon\u2019s Andrew Mason , Zynga\u2019s Mark Pincus , and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg all clocked in at one or two thousand words, Twitter\u2019s letter is just 135, plus an embedded tweet. That\u2019s probably appropriate for a platform that was initially distinguished by the 140-character limit that it imposed on its users. It may also reflect the fact that Twitter isn\u2019t identified with a single founder or executive the way that, say, Facebook is \u2014 none of its founders currently have a full-time role with the company (though apparently co-founders Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone and Ev Williams visited the office today ). And hey, it\u2019s not like the rest of the filing is lacking in a rundown of the company\u2019s perspective on the risks and opportunities that it faces.

People took that idea and strengthened it by using @names to have public conversations, #hashtags to organize movements, and Retweets to spread news around the world.

The company is looking to raise $1 billion in this initial offering, which is set to mint many millionaires among shareholders and founders like Ev Williams, Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone. Currently, the filing does not list a valuation, and sources are saying that\u2019s because they have yet to determine one. Twitter\u2019s revenues have been revealed for the first time, as well. Revenues for 2012 were $316.9 million, for a loss of $79.4 million and in the first half of 2013 they\u2019ve already earned $253.6 million for a loss of $69.3 million. That\u2019s just above estimates from last year but well below tracking of over $600 million for the year. Overall, Twitter has lost $418.6 million since it began. Twitter will be offering up 472,613,753 shares of stock in this initial release. Twitter says that it currently has 218.3 million monthly active users, and those users have created over 300 billion tweets. That MAU number is significantly lower than many had expected at this point as they announced that they had 200 million MAUs in December. Twitter says that it delivers over 200 billion tweets per day. Twitter says that 75 percent of its MAUs access the service from mobile devices (that\u2019s 161.25 million) and that 65 percent of all of its ad revenues come from mobile. This marks a big contrast to Facebook, which had no revenues in mobile at all when it filed for IPO. Twitter says that in the second quarter of 2013 there were approximately 30 billion \u2018online impressions\u2019 of tweets off of its properties. The companies\u2019 current estimates put spam accounts at under 5 percent of MAUs, but says that this may not be accurate. On the employment front, Twitter says that it has gained over 900 employees in the year since June 2012, an increase of 90 percent. It currently employs over 2,000 people. Twitter\u2019s IPO has been a hotly anticipated event for some months now, with news of Twitter\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d filing coming via a tweet last month . The stealth filing was made possible by the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) act, which allows companies with less than $1 billion in revenue to file for an IPO without exposing the details immediately. Twitter lists a number of risk factors in the filing, noting that the business could be harmed if \u201cinfluential users, such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets and brands or certain age demographics\u201d conclude that an alternative product or service is more relevant; they are unable to convince potential new users of the value and usefulness of our products and services; or\u00a0they are unable to combat spam or other hostile or inappropriate usage on the platform.

That dual class structure effectively means that a small number of people can control a public company, even if they don\u2019t own a majority of the company\u2019s shares. You can argue the pros and cons of that structure , but it\u2019s quite common. And it\u2019s why people ranging from the Sulzberger family (New York Times) to Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) to Sergey Brin and Larry Page (Google) get to run what are in many ways private companies, even though their shares trade publicly: There\u2019s almost no chance an outsider can buy up shares and push them around. But Twitter, which is both a media and a tech company, isn\u2019t following in their footsteps. The company\u2019s S-1 notes that it has only one class of shares. So Dick Costolo and Evan Williams aren\u2019t given any special powers \u2014 their shares entitle them to the same voting power that your shares give you. The messaging here is clear: \u201cAt Twitter,\u201d the company\u2019s filing would like to say but can\u2019t because it can\u2019t actually speak, \u201cwe are way more responsive to shareholder interests than many of our peers.\u201d There\u2019s a caveat, of course: Twitter\u2019s board retains the right to issue preferred stock, which could indeed come with special voting rights and other powers.\u00a0It\u2019s the kind of thing you might see employed if a corporate raider like Carl Icahn ever showed up at the door with big ideas.

Today, the social microblogging company that started out its life as another product altogether unveiled its S-1 documents for its public offering of $1 billion. Its symbol will be TWTR, but Twitter did not say where its stock would be traded. In its filing, the company went very cute, with an image of its first tweet by co-founder and Twitter creator Jack Dorsey, noting, \u201cTwitter was born on March 21, 2006 with just 24 characters.\u201d It also included images of tweets from everyone from President Barack Obama to Wheat Thins to the one from Clarence House announcing the new royal baby in England. More importantly, this is the first look at the business of the privately held San Francisco-based Twitter. Revenue for 2012 was $316.9 million. For the first half of 2013, $253.6 million. The company lost $79.4 million in 2012 and lost $69.3 million in the first half of 2013. But, on an adjusted basis, Twitter noted in its filing: \u201cFrom 2011 to 2012, revenue increased by 198% to $316.9 million, net loss decreased by 38% to $79.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 149% to $21.2 million. From the six months ended June 30, 2012 to the six months ended June 30, 2013, revenue increased by 107% to $253.6 million, net loss increased by 41% to $69.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $20.7 million to $21.4 million.\u201d In other words, it is slowly making money, at least from a cash flow perspective. Expectations of revenue were pegged at just about $600 million this year and close to $300 million last year. In the filing, Twitter said it had 215 million active users, or those that use the service at least once a month, sending out 500 million tweets daily. It said in December that it had 200 million. As of midyear, Twitter said it had $164.4 million in cash or cash equivalents. As to the big owners of Twitter, pre-IPO: CEO Dick Costolo with 7.6 million shares, co-founder and chairman Jack Dorsey with 23.4 million shares, co-founder and former CEO and director Evan Williams with 56.9 million shares. Director Peter Fenton held 31.6 million shares for Benchmark Capital. The other big holders, called \u201c5% Stockholders,\u201d include, as I had previously reported: Rizvi Traverse, Spark Capital, Benchmark, Union Square Partners and DST Global. Shares are expected to trade starting in November, which it can do after a 21-day period after the public filing. But it could also delay that, especially if markets suffer due to the recent government shutdown. Twitter is far along in the IPO process, having filed financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. It has since been going back and forth with regulators on issues, confidentially, part of a filing process for companies with revenue of less than $1 billion under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. It released news of the filing in September via \u2014 of course \u2014 a tweet. Twitter will now go on a public road show for investors, although it has been in talks with a number of them already as part of the process. Here are the bankers, for those who care about such things (only the bankers): Goldman Sachs in the lead, with Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as well as smaller players, Allen &amp; Co. and Code Advisors. Here is Twitter\u2019s inevitable tweet about the filing: Our S-1 will be filed publicly with the SEC momentarily. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale. \u2014 Twitter (@twitter) October 3, 2013 And, in its short letter to potential shareholders from @twitter, the company said: We started with a simple idea: share what you\u2019re doing, 140 characters at a time.

The company filed the official IPO documents several weeks ago under the new JOBS Act, which allows companies with a market value of less than $1 billion to keep their filing hidden from public view for at least three weeks. The company said it plans to raise a maximum of $1 billion in the offering, but didn\u2019t say which exchange it will be trading on. Twitter announced on September 12 that it had filed the S-1 with the SEC , but multiple reports said the filing was actually made much earlier, possibly as early as July. In a letter to shareholders, the company said: \u201cThe mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve\u2013and do not detract from\u2013a free and global conversation.\u201d According to the SEC filing, Twitter had $316 million in revenue last year or more than 10 times what it had in 2010. In the six months ended in June, it had revenue of $253 million, or more than twice what it had in the same period of 2012 \u2014 but it recorded a loss of $69 million. In 2012 it lost $49 million. The company said it had free cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $21 million in the first six months of this year. Market value expected to be $15B plus A number of observers speculated before the filing that Twitter could launch its public offering at between $28 and $30 a share , which would give the company a market value of more than $15 billion. Earlier this year, when Blackrock Ventures acquired shares from employees and early investors in a private transaction, the company was valued at about $9 billion \u2014 and in 2011, when Russian venture fund DST Global bought shares, it was valued at $8 billion. An IPO is expected to make several early investors and insiders billionaires, including former CEO Evan Williams and venture investor Chris Sacca. Some early venture groups could also wind up with stakes worth $1 billion or more, including Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital. Twitter has raised a little over $1 billion so far, with some of that being sales by employees and early backers. In the S-1, Twitter says $221 million of the total $253 million in revenue it brought in during the first half of this year came from advertising \u2014 the rest from data licensing. Earlier estimates from industry groups such as eMarketer had estimated that Twitter could make as much as $580 million this year from advertising, which is its main source of revenue. Under the \u201crisk factors\u201d category, Twitter said: \u201cTo the extent our user growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement and ad engagement on Twitter. If people do not perceive our products and services to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract users or increase the frequency of their engagement with our platform and the ads that we display.\u201d Over 215 million active users per month The SEC document says that Twitter has 215 million active users per month, and that 75 percent of them access the service on a mobile device. The company had previously said that it has about 200 million users, although there were no details provided previously about the number of active users, as opposed to dormant accounts. According to the S-1 the service has 100 million daily active users. Some have estimated that the number of fake or automated spam accounts could be as high as 10 percent of the overall number, but Twitter says it is actually 5 percent (although it admits this is an estimate based on a sample). Under risk factors, the S-1 says: \u201cWe anticipate that our user growth rate will slow over time as the size of our user base increases.\u201d Evan Williams According to the S-1 filing, co-founder Jack Dorsey owns just under 5 percent of the company, co-founder and former CEO Ev Williams owns 12 percent and current CEO Dick Costolo owns 1.6 percent. If the stock trades in the expected range of $28 to $30 per share, Williams\u2019s stake would be worth approximately $1.7 billion and Dorsey\u2019s would be worth $700 million. More than the number of users, Twitter\u2019s future rests on the amount of engagement it can show those users having with content from advertisers \u2014 and the data it can provide to those advertisers and partners such as TV networks. The company recently launched a feature called \u201cTwitter Amplify\u201d that allows it to target ads towards users who have been watching a specific TV show, and it has acquired a number of companies such as Bluefin that can crunch that data. One of the big question marks for Twitter is how much bottom-line value that kind of relationship can actually produce, and whether Facebook \u2014 which has also been making a similar pitch to TV networks and advertisers about its value as a social-sharing pipeline \u2014 will be able to steal some of its thunder .

The initial public offering marks the first time that Twitter has been required to make much of its financial data public, and it shows a company that is growing its revenue but still hasn't quite turned a profit. The SEC filing says that Twitter has 218 million monthly active users, up from 200 million in December 2012. The company also says it has seen a 198 percent growth in year-over-year revenue, bringing in $316.9 million in 2012, and a 38 percent decrease in net loss to $79.4 million. For the first half of 2013, the company brought in $253.6 million in revenue and its net loss was tallied at $69.3 million. AllThingsD reminds us that expectations for Twitter's revenues \u201cwere pegged at just about $600 million this year and close to $300 million last year.\u201d So Twitter's IPO will be small, at least compared to Facebook's recent IPO , in which the company said it expected to raise $13 billion on 337,415,352 shares of stock. But Facebook's shares stumbled quite a bit when the company finally got out on the track, with some investors claiming that the company had been overvalued. It has only relatively recently found its footing.

Eyeing a major growth of its office space, Twitter is in discussions with real-estate developer Shorenstein Properties to lease more than 300,000 square feet in a building that neighbors its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco's Mid-Market neighborhood near City Hall, according to multiple people briefed on the talks. No lease has been signed, and the landlord continues to talk to other potential tenants for the space in the 10-story building known as 1Tenth, the people said. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment. The discussions suggest an aggressive growth plan: The space would nearly double Twitter's existing footprint and could accommodate more than 2,000 additional employees\u2014roughly the size of its existing global workforce. The company first leased about 215,000 square feet at 1355 Market Street\u2014a former furniture mart built in the 1930s\u2014from Shorenstein in 2011. At the time, Twitter's lease was considered a path-breaking move for the gritty Mid-Market neighborhood. It subsequently moved into another 85,000 square feet in the building, and it has exercised options for additional space that would bring its total to about 400,000 square feet. City officials have tried for decades to spruce up the neighborhood, long populated by a large number of homeless people and payday loan shops. But Twitter's move in 2011 and incentives put in place by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee helped unleash a wave of tech-company migration to the area. New entrants include mobile-payment company Square Inc. and corporate-focused social-networking company Yammer Inc. \u2014Yoree Koh contributed to this article Write to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com A version of this article appeared October 3, 2013, on page B5 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Twitter Seeks to Expand in San Francisco.", "lede": "As it gears up for an initial public offering, social-media giant...", "link": "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304176904579111834120993134.html"}, {"author": "Ryan Tate", "title": "Twitter Files for IPO, Shows $317M in Revenue", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 22:23:00", "content": "Twitter has filed to go public, saying it will sell shares under the name TWTR. The IPO will initially seek to raise up to $1 billion. In its first public disclosure of financial performance, Twitter revealed it is growing revenue fast but losing money. In a registration filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, known as a \u201cform S-1,\u201d Twitter says its revenue increased to $316.9 million in 2012, from $106 million in 2011. Its net loss for 2012 was $79 million. In the first six months of this year, according to the filing, it pulled in $253.7 million in revenue, up from $122 million in the first six months of 2012. But its losses appear to be widening. The company lost $69 million in the first six months of this year, not far from its total loss for all of last year. The company said it had 218.3 million users per month, on average, for the three-month period ended in June. That\u2019s up from 85 million users per month in the same period last year. Before going public, the company must first wait through a three-week quiet period. After a \u201croad show\u201d that markets shares, Twitter and its underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs, will set a price for them. Twitter stock won\u2019t be available to the public, then, until November. Twitter had reportedly been planning to raise $1.5 billion with an offering of 50 million to 55 million shares priced at $28 to $30 each. Its 2013 revenue had been estimated at $545 million by eMarketer, set to rise to $807 million in 2014. Twitter said more than 65 percent of its advertising revenue came from mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. Because mobile advertising revenue is growing much more quickly than desktop advertising revenue in developed markets like the U.S., some believe Twitter has as a significant advantage over rivals like Facebook, which gleaned just 41 percent of ad revenue from mobile in its most recent quarter. Twitter\u2019s IPO filing marks its first release of revenue and profit figures, providing an unprecedented glimpse into the company\u2019s financial health and growth prospects. More broadly, the filing sets the tone for one of the most anticipated IPOs in the current tech boom, matched only by the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn. Enthusiasm for Twitter shares could encourage more tech companies to go public rather than wait or sell themselves to larger competitors. Among the companies rumored to be weighing an IPO this year are enterprise storage firm Box; big data outfit Palantir; payment provider Square, which shares co-founder Jack Dorsey with Twitter; marketing software company HubSpot; and discount retailer Gilt. Launched in 2006 as a way to circulate text messages among groups, Twitter quickly expanded beyond the California tech cognoscenti to become a global phenomenon, with everyone from Hollywood celebrities to world political leaders to political dissidents trading messages via the web, smartphone apps, and SMS messages. But Twitter repeatedly hit scaling and stability problems and was slow to monetize its popularity. That helps explain why Twitter\u2019s IPO will be much smaller than Facebook\u2019s $16 billion offering in May 2012. Twitter\u2019s lower revenue did help it in one regard: Since the company\u2019s annual sales are below $1 billion, it was able to submit a draft version of its S-1 to federal regulators back in July and was then presumably able to incorporate the feds\u2019 confidential feedback into the final S-1 filed today. Typically, draft filings and SEC feedback are submitted in full public view, but under the recently-enacted JOBS Act smaller companies like Twitter may keep the process private.", "lede": "Twitter has filed to go public, saying it will sell shares under ...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/twitter-files-for-ipo-2/"}]}, {"cluster": 19, "articles": [{"author": "Catherine Shu", "title": "WeLend Brings Online Social Lending To Hong Kong", "feed_title": "TechCrunch", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:31:40", "content": "Founded by WeLab, a finance startup, WeLend is the first social lending platform based in Hong Kong. Since launching in early July, WeLab says it has received US$4 million in loan applications. The social, or peer-to-peer, lending industry in the U.S. has existed since 2006, when Prosper and Lending Club were both founded. In mainland China, prominent peer-to-peer lending platforms include Creditease , SinoLending and PPDai . Despite Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international financial center, however, there were no peer-to-peer lending platforms before WeLend launched. Simon Loong, the founder and CEO of WeLab, says the startup is currently focused on educating potential borrowers about WeLend\u2019s services. Loong hopes his fifteen years in the banking industry, including a position as North East Asia Regional Head of Unsecured Lending at Standard Chartered Bank, will help WeLend gain credibility and grow. Though informal lending clubs are common in Hong Kong, barriers to entry for peer-to-peer platforms include stringent financial regulations and competition from dominant players in the banking industry such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citicorp. \u201cIn the past when you resided in the same village, you\u2019d lend money to one another. That\u2019s the essential concept behind the peer-to-peer model,\u201d says Loong. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting fact that we hear often when we do user education. People say that their grandfather\u2019s generation did this in their village. Now we are looking at how we can scale that model by using our banking experience.\u201d \u00a0 WeLab holds a money lenders license in Hong Kong and currently only accepts loans from lenders in the company\u2019s private network. WeLend assesses potential borrowers based their credit rating, as well as information such as income, occupation and property ownership. To optimize returns on its portfolio, WeLend currently only approves 20% of loan applicants. Many of WeLend\u2019s applicants want to consolidate debt and the platform also targets small-to-medium businesses seeking to borrow money. Its typical loan amount is currently US$10,000 to US$20,000 for a 24-month term. Like Prosper and LendingClub, WeLend entices borrowers by offering lower interest rates than banks and other traditional financial institutions. The platform says its annual percentage rate (APR) ranges from 3% to 25%, compared to 7% to 35% offered by banks or 10% to 60% offered by consumer finance companies. Another attraction for borrowers is WeLend\u2019s one-day application process, compared to the five to seven days required by many banks. \u201cSo far we have US$4 million in loan applications, and momentum is good,\u201d says Loong. \u201cIt took us 45 days to reach the first million, and 15 days to get to the second million in applications.\u201d WeLab\u2019s next step is exploring how to scale up WeLend by understanding regulations and borrowing behaviors in different Asian countries. Loong says by targeting smaller, mature markets, WeLend has an advantage over peer-to-peer lending platforms in larger countries like U.S., China and UK. \u201cThere are few mature Asian markets and knowing how to do one market doesn\u2019t give you scalability. It\u2019s still a relatively new concept for the U.S., China and UK,\u201d says Loong. \u201cThey still have a long way to go domestically before international expansion, but we know the local, mature Asian markets.\u201d In addition to WeLend, WeLab will focus on building other online products that \u201cdemocratize finance.\u201d The startup has already raised a round of seed funding from private investors and is planning to raise a Series A in the first half of 2014. WeLab operates WeLend, Hong Kong\u2019s first peer-to-peer lending platform. Our ultimate goal is to provide people with the opportunity to borrow, invest, and connect through a secure, professional, and efficient platform. By removing expensive middlemen and other complexities from our business model, we make securing a personal loan easy and affordable.

It isn\u2019t clear exactly how the two operating systems would share the handset, in terms of allowing dual-booting or making a user choose a default at device setup, but it\u2019s a sign Redmond may be thinking about pulling out all the stops to get people using its mobile OS. These talks are in very early stages, according to Bloomberg\u2019s sources, and there\u2019s a possibility that Microsoft may even reduce or eliminate its licensing fee for Windows Phone to make it more attractive to HTC. HTC seems to be a target because it\u2019s a former partner that has already built both Windows and Android hardware (though it doesn\u2019t seem to be too keen on delivering more on the Windows Phone side). Microsoft\u2019s head of Operating Systems Terry Myerson is said to be heading to Taiwan to discuss the arrangement in further detail with HTC, says Bloomberg. There are a couple of reasons this makes sense, including some information TechCrunch has heard about Microsoft and its organizational sentiment towards Android. First, HTC has been one of Microsoft\u2019s few hardware partners for Windows Phone, and that relationship is likely strained given the Nokia hardware division purchase. Second, HTC is in a bad way in terms of continuing poor financial performance, and in terms of device sales, so it\u2019s probably very willing to consider unorthodox models to help it gain some unique appeal for users. As to what we\u2019ve heard about internal feelings on Android at Microsoft, a source suggests that there are contingents of younger engineers at the company who pushed hard to have Android/Windows dual-booting on Surface tablet devices, so there\u2019s a willingness to experiment with things very much like this HTC dual-OS smartphone. Those ideas, TechCrunch has been told, came from younger elements within Microsoft\u2019s mobile engineering team, and were not embraced by the older more established elements of senior management. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is leaving within the next year, he announced back in August, and there have been other big executive shifts at the company lately, too, including the departure of Xbox head Don Mattrick and Windows lead Steven Sinofsky. This may have changed the culture enough at Microsoft to allow some of the more radical new ideas to gain better purchase, which could result in an HTC device that lets users choose not one, but two mobile operating systems with one device buy. Launch Date: 1997 IPO: April 4, 2002, TPE:2498 HTC Corp, (TAIEX: 2498) produces smartphones running the Android and Windows Phone 8 operating systems for themselves and as an OEM to other manufacturers.

Something that shows just how crazy talented you and your teammates are. Remember: this is a Hackathon. Our judges wont be looking for the thing with the best potential business model \u2014 they\u2019re looking for something that makes them stop and say \u201c Whoa. \u201c We\u2019re changing things up a bit this time around. Since it\u2019s our first big event outside of the US in some time, we\u2019re keepin\u2019 the attendee list for this Hackathon a bit smaller than its stateside counterparts. We\u2019ve got a newly polished set of rules to keep things fair and to help make sure everyone at the event has a great time and, like all of TechCrunch\u2019s upcoming events, our anti-harassment policy is in full effect here. Oh, and just to sweeten the deal a bit more: even if you don\u2019t take one of the top three spots or win one of the awesome API sponsor prizes, there\u2019s still something great up for grabs. Each of the top 40-or-so teams (with the final number depending on how many teams enter) who present will get two tickets to the entirety of the Disrupt Europe conference, normally valued at nearly $1k each. Why? Because we think you\u2019re rad. As long as you\u2019re building something, participating in the Hackathon is free. Interested sponsors, give us a shout . We released the first batch of tickets last week, and it was by far the biggest batch we\u2019ll release. Every batch we release will get smaller and smaller \u2014 so if you\u2019re looking to attend, make sure you register quick.

As music streaming services around the world face down the international expansion of Spotify and Deezer , Dhingana CEO Rohit Bhatia says the startup is hedging its bets on a mobile-first strategy as well as growth in international markets. Over 75% of its users access its one-million song library from mobile devices, which the startup says marks a 200% growth year-over-year. Dhingana, which is based in Pune, India and Sunnyvale, Ca., says half of its monthly active users come from outside of India. The U.S. accounts for most of that number, with 2.5 million users, while 1 million access the service from Europe and the U.K. Within India, Dhingana\u2019s cross-platform strategy is tailored for the country\u2019s fragmented mobile marketplace, where featurephones still dominate but smartphone shipments are growing rapidly . According to Dhingana, its apps have been downloaded over 6 million times across Android, iOS, Windows 8, BlackBerry, Nokia and Amazon Kindle platforms. CEO Rohit Bhatia says Dhingana has achieve most of its growth from organic traffic and spends almost nothing on marketing. The service, however, faces several major competitors. Though Spotify and Deezer have not launched in India yet, both are focusing on international expansion \u00a0and India\u2019s fast-growing Internet user base presents an attractive opportunity.\u00a0Dhingana\u2019s main domestic competitors include Saavn and Gaana , both of which also want to leverage international growth. For example, Saavn, which\u00a0claimed 10 million monthly active visitors at the beginning of this year , is taking a double-pronged approach to user acquisition by offering an English-language service for foreign audiences with a taste for Bollywood music while building its catalog of Western tracks for Indian listeners. Gaana, a music streaming service backed by\u00a0 Times Internet , one of India\u2019s largest Internet companies,\u00a0 says international audiences make up a large part of its user base . Other Indian streaming music services include Raaga and MusicIndiaOnline.CO . Bhatia says Dhingana\u2019s competitive advantage is offering a vast array of music for every language and region in India with tracks in more than 42 languages and genres. \u201cIt took Dhingana almost over a year and a half to sign licensing agreements with 900-plus labels,\u201d says Bhatia. \u201cIf you want to be a truly Indian music streaming service, you have to sign up with all the regional labels, so it can be pretty time-consuming.\u201d Another advantage it has over international competitors such as Spotify is its network of micropayment methods, which is important because India has a credit card penetration rate of just 1.7% . Dhingana also hopes its mobile-first strategy will help it attract listeners. In addition to a mobile-optimized site, it also has Web apps for Opera and UC Browser, two of India\u2019s top mobile browsers. Once users switch to smartphones, Dhingana sends a push notification prompting them to download the app for their operating system. Bhatia says Dhingana also focuses on search-engine optimization so its Web site shows up near the top of search results for popular tracks. The service currently monetizes through ads and a premium subscription service called Dhingana Gold , which is in a in-app purchase through its free iOS app . The startup raised a Series B of $7 million in October 2012 from Lightspeed Venture Partners , with participation from previous investors\u00a0Inventus Capital Partners and Helion Venture Partners. Launch Date: 2007 Funding: $7M Dhingana is an Indian on-demand music service that wants its users to discover new traditional Indian and Bollywood music across the globe. Dhingana gives access to millions of songs in more than 35 Indian languages and genres. The service is available for iOS, Blackberry, Google\u2019s Play Store, Nokia Devices and on its homepage.

Being a communication backbone of the web has its pluses and minuses. Twitter gets lots of content syndicated from other sites, but those contributors don\u2019t necessarily visit Twitter or see its ads. That last part is a problem, especially since these blind tweeters count as some of Twitter\u2019s 218.3 million active users. Twitter explains on page 61 of its S-1 filing \u00a0that an \u201cactive user\u201d includes not only people that actually visit its site and mobile apps, but also \u201cTwitter users who logged in and accessed Twitter through\u2026registered third-party applications or websites.\u201d Those users do push content to Twitter that draws people to its feed where it shows ads, so they help the site monetize. But they also aren\u2019t seeing ads themselves. There are tons of ways to syndicate to Twitter. People auto-tweet their blog posts, Tumblr updates and even their Facebook posts. IFTTT and other automation services make this easy. In its pre-monetization phase, getting more content may have been the right bet, and still may be, but it could make Twitter seem larger than it is. \u201cI don\u2019t really go on Twitter anymore but I share my Instagrams there,\u201d a friend told me today. These Insta-pushers are even worse for Twitter than non-visiting contributors from elsewhere, because Instagram pulled support for Twitter Cards. That means rather than lingering on Twitter and viewing Instagrams in-line, people are whisked to Instagram\u2019s website\u2026where they don\u2019t see Twitter ads. My friend is not alone, considering that Twitter listed \u201cthe degree to which users access Twitter content through applications that do not contain our ads\u201d as one of its risks.\u00a0Yet it doesn\u2019t break out users who actually visit its feed from those who don\u2019t. If that number is a significant percentage of Twitter\u2019s total active user count, bankers might want Twitter to disclose it in revisions to its S-1 in the upcoming weeks before it actually goes public.

But its newest market is a little closer to home: Beginning Friday evening, riders in certain parts of Silicon Valley will be able to start requesting rides. Lyft, of course, is incredibly popular in its home market of San Francisco, where it launched and where it\u2019s been operating for the past year and a half. As a result, it\u2019s not surprising to see the company extend the service farther south. After all, with so many people in SF working on the peninsula \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 there was likely a number of people who were able to use Lyft in one place who wished to use it in the other. The launch, which happens tomorrow evening, will expand availability in the South Bay but it won\u2019t totally cover the area. Lyft\u2019s Silicon Valley service stretches from Menlo Park down to San Jose, but at launch it won\u2019t accept rides between the San Francisco city limits and, say, Redwood City. (It will drop off in those areas, so long as the ride originates in SF or farther south in Silicon Valley.) According to Lyft CEO Logan Green, the company is taking the same approach that it took in Los Angeles, its second market. With that launch, the ride-sharing service made itself available in just one specific part of the wide sprawl of the city: Santa Monica and Venice. Later, it expanded to other parts of the city as it felt comfortable with its ability to serve each new neighborhood. In the same way, Lyft decided to light up the \u201cdensest, most-active swath\u201d of the Silicon Valley market and make sure it could provide an adequate level of service there before expanding. It will close the gap between SF and Menlo Park over time \u2014 and eventually, it will likely expand into Oakland and the East Bay to serve the entire \u201cSan Francisco Bay Area.\u201d Lyft expects to see other similarities between Silicon Valley and L.A., like a longer average trip length. Green said that the average trip in cities like San Francisco tends to be about two miles, while in the suburbs you\u2019ll see it be more like four or five miles. But traffic is usually less intense than in the center of major cities. According to Green, Silicon Valley pricing per mile will be tuned down slightly from what San Francisco riders can expect to account for the longer average trip length and less traffic. Green says that Lyft is ramped up for a bigger launch than normal, but that the company expects to be able to meet Silicon Valley demand. In part, that\u2019s because a lot more people in Silicon Valley have cars than those in San Francisco. For a ride-sharing company, one of the advantages of operating in more suburban markets is that the number of potential drivers is a lot higher than in cities where everyone takes public transportation. Lyft has raised $82 million from investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Mayfield Fund, K9 Ventures, and Floodgate. Launch Date: 2007 Funding: $82.5M Your friend with a car\u2122 Lyft is a friendly, safe, affordable transportation option. Download the app for iPhone or Android and request a ride with the tap of a button; a friendly driver will arrive in minutes to take you where you need to go.

The company raised $1.16 billion prior to its planned initial public offering , which could total $1 billion itself. Here\u2019s another figure: Twitter\u2019s accumulated deficit to date is $418.6 million, a figure that will race to $748.2 million once it goes public and realizes\u00a0$329.6 million in costs related to\u00a0stock-based compensation expenses. This is not to say that Twitter has spent $418.6 million to date; that figure is far higher. Accumulated deficit can be viewed as the company\u2019s net income, net loss and paid dividends added together as debits and credits. So the formula is net income, minus net loss, minus paid dividends. Twitter pays no dividends, so its accumulated deficit is simply the amount of money that it has spent\u00a0 more than it has brought in as revenue in its life. In a simple way, it\u2019s the money that Twitter had to raise to keep its lights on during its growth. The company continues to lose money on a GAAP basis, and even on an adjusted net loss scale. So we can expect that Twitter\u2019s accumulated deficit will increase in time. The company doesn\u2019t appear to be operating in a way that would place it on a quick ramp to profitability, its loss rising year over year when the first half of 2013 is compared to the similar period in 2012. Twitter is not alone in having a large accumulated deficit. In 2005, for example, Amazon reported a $2.2 billion accumulated loss . That was a full decade after its birth and eight years after its initial public offering.\u00a0Trulia, by way of another comparison, had an accumulated deficit of $44 million before it went public. If Twitter raised more than $1 billion, but has an accumulated deficit of just $418.6 million, where did the rest of the money go? It still has quite a lot of it left, with cash on hand of $164.5 million and short-term investments of $210.5 million.\u00a0Twitter is about to become far more cash rich, following its offering, but not profitable.

To my utter shock it was the Venue 8 Pro, the company\u2019s first pint-sized Windows 8 tablet. Let\u2019s start with its looks. The lightweight, plastic body screams \u201cgeneric,\u201d and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to differentiate it from the Android-powered cousins we looked at earlier. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s completely devoid of nice touches, though: The back plate features a pattern of concentric circles that break up the monotony of an otherwise plain soft-touch finish and seems to help with grip. The Venue 8 Pro is unexpectedly light, too, as it weighs a relatively scant .87 pounds \u2014 that\u2019s well within striking distance of the iPad mini. That said, the Venue 8 Pro suffers from a distinct lack of style. It\u2019s perhaps to be expected considering that this is Dell\u2019s first attempt at bringing a full-on Windows 8 experience to a device like this, and there\u2019s a lot that could go wrong with this sort of endeavor. Take the screen, for instance. One of my favorite reviews ever written features Paul Thurrott just eviscerating Acer\u2019s Windows 8-powered Iconia W3 tablet for its godawful screen. Some may say he was too heavy-handed in his criticism, but when the primary means of consuming and interacting with your content just sucks, something is very very wrong. Thankfully, early stinkers like the Acer make Dell\u2019s approach seem all the more palatable. The Pro\u2019s IPS screen \u2014 which ran at 1280 x 800 \u2014 was bright and well-saturated, and viewing angles seemed more than respectable during the brief moments I spent playing with the thing. Of course, the screen\u2019s size poses some issues. There\u2019s no denying that parts of Windows 8.1 just aren\u2019t suited for such small displays. The classic desktop mode is cramped and festooned with tiny icons that require a fair amount of dexterity to poke at accurately. Dell plans to downplay some of those issues by selling an active stylus that allows for precise manipulation of screen elements \u2014 I took that thing for a spin too and came away impressed. Part of the stylus\u2019s appeal is because Dell fought the urge to make it small enough to slot into the Venue\u2019s chassis. Instead the company opted to make a full-sized pen, which helps dramatically with usability (though you\u2019ll have to tuck it into a case or a pocket). And then there\u2019s longevity to consider. I\u2019m told that the battery is slated to last between 8 and 10 hours of normal use (whatever that is). That wouldn\u2019t amount to much if this thing wound up trading off performance for power, but the whole package seemed suitably snappy thanks to its 1.8GHz quad-core Intel Bay Trail chipset. We\u2019ll see if that remains the case once the final devices start trickling out into the wild. After being let down in such a big way by Microsoft\u2019s original Surface RT, I thought I\u2019d never splurge on a Windows tablet again. Now, after having played with Dell\u2019s attempt, I find myself rethinking my earlier position. The prospect of running full Windows apps on a device this light and this cheap is a terribly attractive one, and at this moment Dell\u2019s tiny tab seems well-equipped to take on what few Windows competitors are playing at this size. I may even buy this thing over the iPad mini, which is yet another thing I never thought I\u2019d say. Stay tuned for the full review in short order.

As with every S-1 filing, the company reports which individuals/firms hold the most shares in the company. According to this table , founder Evan Williams owns 12 percent of the company before the offering. Benchmark and the firm\u2019s partner and board member Peter Fenton owns 6.7 percent. Fellow founder Jack Dorsey owns 4.9 percent and CEO Dick Costolo owns 1.6 percent. Other stock holders that own 5 percent or more of the company include Rizvi Traverse (which is reportedly backed by Chris Sacca ), Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and DST. It\u2019s not clear how much each investor owns specifically. Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital were Twitter\u2019s earliest institutional investors (USV led the company\u2019s first major round, and Spark Capital led Twitter\u2019s second round), as was Charles River Ventures, who is not listed in the table and put in around $250,000 early on.

We\u2019re also hearing that after Rizvi, Williams is the next largest single shareholder followed by Benchmark, Spark, USV and then DST.

In the S-1 form that the company filed today for its public offering, Twitter called mobile the \u201cprimary driver of our business.\u201d It said that 75% of its 218.3 million+ monthly active users are accessing the site from mobile devices \u2014 or 161.25 million users. And mobile accounts for 65% of all its ad revenues. All in all, the word \u201cmobile\u201d comes up 130 times in the 160+ page document. From the intro to the filing: Mobile has become the primary driver of our business. Our mobile products are critical to the value we create for our users, and they enable our users to create, distribute and discover content in the moment and on-the-go. The 140 character constraint of a Tweet emanates from our origins as an SMS-based messaging system, and we leverage this simplicity to develop products that seamlessly bridge our user experience across all devices. In the three months ended June 30, 2013, 75% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device, including mobile phones and tablets, and over 65% of our advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. We expect that the proportion of active users on, and advertising revenue generated from, mobile devices, will continue to grow in the near term. If you recall, when Facebook filed its S-1 before going public, the company had no revenues in mobile and made a big point of spelling that out, with 425 million of its 845 million monthly active users accessing the service from mobile devices (those are from the initial S-1, which got revised up several times before the company finally listed). Twitter is in a significantly different position. Not only does the company have a majority of its users accessing from mobile devices, but it already make a majority of its ad revenues from these platforms. (The main ad unit currently on Android and iOS, Promoted Products, was introduced in February 2012.) While there have been a lot of changes to the basic desktop product over the last couple of years, in 2013 you could argue that the biggest product moves that Twitter has made have been in mobile, from the launch of the Vine video app (to follow through on the photo filters that it launched near the end of 2012) through to its experiments with Twitter Music (also a mobile app), and its acquisition of MoPub (a specialist in mobile ad-tech). Twitter pretty much says it all about mobile and its ambitions to push the envelope in that area, in a bit of very typical S-1 jargon: \u201cIf new or enhanced products or services fail to engage users and advertisers, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue or operating profit to justify our investments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\u201d With 130 mentions of mobile in the S-1, here are a few of the interesting points that jumped out at me in a first reading: \u2013 The big threat in mobile for Twitter is in Asia . Specifically, it pinpoints the rise of multiple local messaging apps. \u201cIncreased competition from local websites, mobile applications and services that provide real-time communications, such as Sina Weibo in China, LINE in Japan and Kakao in South Korea, which have expanded and may continue to expand their geographic footprint,\u201d it writes. \u2013 Mobile can be misleading . \u201cOur metrics are also affected by mobile applications that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved, and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs.\u201d \u2013 Mobile growth .

While mobile still represents a seemingly small percentage of overall revenue \u2014 generally between two percent and 10 percent depending on the business \u2014 the growth rate is impossible to deny. A recent study by IBM found that mobile commerce grew by 31 percent in Q1 of 2013, outpacing all e-commerce at 20 percent and in-store at 3.7 percent. Any statistician will tell you that percentages are only as good as their perspective size, coercing many marketing strategies to focus on other \u201cchannels.\u201d However \u2014 to be blunt \u2014 mobile is not a channel. It begins, reinforces and sometimes completes all channels. By not understanding the influence that mobile devices exert in all revenue centers, any company is susceptible to losing revenue at 25 times that of direct mobile revenue. Applying research from a March 2013 Deloitte study , mobile can influence traditional in-store purchases by an astounding 17x. In addition, BloomReach\u2019s internal data anonymously connecting mobile and Web usage on the same merchant shows that mobile can influence a desktop e-commerce channel by up to 7x. So, hypothetically, a company that loses $10 million in yearly mobile revenue that provides poor mobile experiences stands to lose $70 million from desktop revenue and an additional $170 million from in-store purchases \u2014 totaling a whopping $250 million. Think it\u2019s not possible? Well, a recent Harris poll found that 90 percent of consumers think negatively of a brand if they have poorly performing mobile experiences, and Google found that 61 percent of consumers will leave a mobile site immediately if they don\u2019t find what they want right away. While many companies have responded with a mobile \u201cskin\u201d around traditional websites using responsive design or mobile proxy solutions, consumers want more relevant, more intuitive content in less time. Each situation is obviously unique, but below I\u2019ll discuss five elements to consider and understand when taking a mobile-centric view of brand-to-consumer experiences. Mobile is the channel \u201cglue\u201d Have you ever taken a moment to look up at a group of passengers waiting to board a plane, heads bowed with the dull reflection of a mobile-device screen on their face? Probably not, because you also were checking your email, perusing social media or reading the newest gadget review on AllThingsD . Mobile devices \u2014 especially smartphones \u2014 are the most personal device in history. Constantly tethered to your side, they help you compare prices, find brick-and-mortar locations or see what your friends are interested in buying. Thus, understanding traffic origin can provide you with distinct clues behind the nature of a shopper. For example, analyzing metrics like time-on-site, bounce rates and number of pages discovered from each channel (even while in-store) can intuitively advise you about the best content and site navigation to provide. You have a data problem, not a design problem What good is a beautiful mobile site when product discovery is frustrating, causing visitors to leave in aggravation? It sounds obvious, but that\u2019s one of the top frustrations that lead to lost sales and negative brand associations on mobile sites. Companies have invested thousands into building gorgeous imagery, social features and catchy copy, but mobile sites ultimately boil down to utility and relevance. In a perfect world, we could just access a Siri-like interface that easily interprets our language and automatically determines our intentions, returning appropriate results and suggestions that fit our patterns and past behavior. While I\u2019m speaking somewhat futuristically, the underlying point is the same. Being able to collect, correctly predict and intuitively respond to the data/signals provided by shoppers is key to maximizing conversions. If done well, shopping on a mobile device can feel like browsing through a brick-and-mortar store with a personal shopper helping you to get closer and closer to the perfect product. Conversely, if the data is poor or incorrectly interpreted, then shoppers can be left with a frustrating series of dead-end searches and irrelevant products. For example, just because a visitor\u2019s time-on-site is high doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re satisfied. They could be aimlessly bouncing from page to page through category hierarchies \u2014 a common characteristic of infrastructures built for desktops a decade ago. Email is mobile American Eagle Outfitters recently cited that 70 percent of its loyalty emails are opened on a mobile device. While optimizing emails to be viewed on a smartphone may be a no-brainer, it\u2019s more important to correlate the mobile-site experience when they click through. A landing page should be consistent with the email look, feel, content and offer. With what content did they engage, and are there easily accessible links to other elements of the email offer? We are bombarded by marketing emails daily, so unlike other channels, consumers give very valuable insight simply because they are inspired by the subject line. Even if they ultimately don\u2019t access content directly in-line with the ever-important subject line , providing a dynamic experience that promotes effortless discovery of the intended purpose gives invaluable information \u2014 which includes engaging a loyal mobile shopper after the first landing page. However, one thing is certain. With email click-through rates hovering around 4.5 percent , one or two bad landing pages following an email click-through will leave you in the other 94.5 percent or completely opted-out. Location, location, location Store locators are still one of the top reasons that consumers visit mobile sites. However, it\u2019s important to remember that shoppers use their smartphones at every step on the path to purchase, including in a physical location. A retailer must connect users\u2019 location-based signals with items in stock and correct prices. There is nothing more frustrating than finding the perfect product on sale in the right size only to find out that the item is out of stock at the desired location. This makes real-time data integration extremely important. Consumers don\u2019t care if a company \u201cjust ran out\u201d or is \u201cexpecting a shipment.\u201d And, if a mobile shopper is looking at a product page (especially on an in-store Wi-Fi network, which 36.5 percent use to connect to that same store\u2019s website \u2014 the No. 1 mobile destination for the in-store shopper), help them find out where they can buy it right away or provide an expected delivery time, if absolutely necessary. Checkout While mobile commerce has seen tremendous growth, consumers are still extremely uncomfortable with whipping out a credit card while on the go. Clumsy fingers and security concerns severely limit the full revenue potential. As much as 90 percent of consumers don\u2019t log into a brand\u2019s sites (mobile or Web), so checkout should be convenient and fully functioning (e.g., avoid too many pop-up steps or unclear completion notices), without scary and invasive tactics. Consider having simple integrations with a device\u2019s email or social-messaging functions where a consumer can be reminded about intended purchases or liked items. Plus, it\u2019s a good way to combine past behavioral data to make enhanced and deeper product discovery more relevant. These are just five of the top things to consider and constantly improve. But the types of available data, ways to slice it and methods to act upon it far exceed where responsive design or mobile-commerce platforms have taken the mobile-commerce industry thus far. It was a good place to start, but it has become more the norm rather than the solution. The differentiating factors lie in the data a brand can crunch and integrate externally, in concert with internal data across channels. In the end \u2014 at least to this point \u2014 mobile is the connective tissue that binds together all marketing efforts, and can make or break any initiative. With giants like Amazon and Walmart Labs investing billions on technology to churn through terabytes of data where every nuance of consumer experience is optimized, developing data-driven strategies that are mobile-centric provides the best chance for survival.

But he\u2019s not making a CEO salary. In August, Costolo reduced his annual take-home compensation to a mere $14,000 annually, down from the $200,000 yearly comp that he and president of global revenue Adam Bain each received in 2012. While it may be more than the $1 a year salary that Mark Zuckerberg gives himself, it\u2019s no fat monthly paycheck. (And perhaps it\u2019s a nod to Twitter\u2019s famous tweet character limit of 140 characters.) Granted, there\u2019s one big caveat: Costolo is taking most of his pay in Twitter shares. Last year Costolo made $11.5 million, most of which came from stock and option awards. Costolo has also sold some shares. Along with chairman Jack Dorsey and COO Ali Rowghani, he sold some stock in 2011 to Yuri Milner\u2019s DST Global and investor Rizvi Traverse. Worth noting: Of the three highest-paid people on Twitter\u2019s executive compensation table, one in particular stands out. Christopher Fry, Twitter\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, made $10.34 million in 2012 (again, almost entirely from stock awards) \u2014 apparently more than CTO Adam Messinger, CFO Mike Gupta and COO Rowghani. As I noted in March, Messinger poached Fry from Salesforce back in 2012 , originally to work on infrastructure. But eventually, Fry made his way to working on consumer applications. Perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s considered so important \u2014 at least in terms of salary.

But Williams and Stone have moved on. And under current CEO Dick Costolo, Twitter has very quickly become an advertising company. Twitter only formally started selling ads in April 2010 , about six months after Costolo joined the company, originally as chief operating officer. But those were basically tests, and Twitter only generated $7.3 million in ad revenue that year. The next year, that number leapt to $77.7 million, and last year Twitter\u2019s ad salesforce generated $269.4 million. This year, the company may come close to doubling last year\u2019s number: In the first half of 2013, Twitter sold more than $221 million worth of ads. (Click chart to enlarge.) That\u2019s a very nice-looking ramp, and that\u2019s very much part of a plan. Twitter\u2019s sales team, lead by chief revenue officer Adam Bain, has argued for a while that it could have made more money, earlier, but that it wanted to bring in advertisers slowly \u2014 both because the company needed to make sure it had stuff it could sell them, and also because they wanted a nice-looking ramp. So mission accomplished, optically: With an eye on Facebook\u2019s struggles in the last couple years, Twitter has also made a point of noting that the service is in large part a mobile service, and that its ads have always worked for mobile users. In the second quarter of this year, Twitter notes, 65 percent of its ad revenue came from Apple iOS and Google Android devices.

That number, according to sources, could be closer to what Twitter\u2019s actual MAU number is today. Regardless: Stack that up against Facebook\u2019s 815 million monthly active users the company had at the time of its S-1 filing , and it\u2019s clear: Twitter is big, but it\u2019s no social behemoth. Twitter drills down a little bit more on a few other areas: The company sees more than 100 million daily active users, and 75 percent of those access the site from a mobile device. That could be a bright spot for potential investors, who have recently grown more confident in Internet companies\u2019 ability to monetize mobile platforms. On the one hand, Twitter hopes to jumpstart growth in a few ways over the coming months; the company has sent some of its top chiefs abroad to expand international efforts , Twitter\u2019s highest expected areas of growth in the future, according to the S-1. And the company also has a massive redesign in the works to its iOS application , with Android and other mobile platforms likely to follow. That new look could court more mainstream users who have often found the service difficult to crack \u2014 or at least tough to keep coming back to. Of course, there\u2019s a caveat here, too. Twitter just bought MoPub, a mobile advertising platform considered one of the most powerful and effective in the industry. As the S-1 notes, Twitter doesn\u2019t just plan to integrate MoPub\u2019s technology into the existing Twitter advertising platform. Twitter also plans \u201cto grow MoPub\u2019s current business, including by extending advertising across the mobile ecosystem through the MoPub exchange.\u201d In other words, Twitter can still make money by helping other people buy ads \u2014 even if they aren\u2019t Twitter ads. The numbers speak for themselves. Twitter may aim to be the global town square \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly not an overcrowded one. RELATED POSTS:", "lede": "Twitter has a growth problem.

That didn\u2019t happen overnight. The Chinese Internet giant has methodically leapt from online era to era since being founded in 1998, according to company president Martin Lau. Tencent President Martin Lau For instance, a few years ago, Tencent completely reorganized around what was coming next \u2014 moving more than half of its 20,000 employees to focus on mobile, Lau said today at the China 2.0 conference at Stanford University. One of the main results of that effort was the mobile messaging product Weixin. It worked. Weixin had 236 million monthly active users as of this summer, Lau said. But Weixin is part of a larger library of products: QQ instant messenger has 818 million monthly active users, Tencent mail has 274 million, and Tencent Weibo microblogging has 220 monthly active users. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018You have a hodgepodge of different services, so what is the core?\u2019\u201d Lau said. \u201cThe core, I would say, is the comprehensive social infrastructure. At core, we are a social company.\u201d Sure, it might be more convenient for Tencent to have one service to rule them all, Lau admitted. But the portfolio of products emerged over the years, rather than arriving as a fully formed unit. \u201cAll these services came at a different time,\u201d he said. \u201c[Tencent's social network] Qzone came when asynchronous chat became possible. Weixin came when we saw a big wave of mobile Internet coming.\u201d At this point, it would be technically difficult to combine everything and make it all compatible, Lau said \u2014 but Tencent does try to provide a common ID system and a common monetization back end. Tencent had $4.5 billion in revenue in the first half of 2013. Where did it come from? Not advertising, like U.S.-based social networks. Only nine percent of Tencent revenue is based on ads. Seventy percent of revenue comes from user payments, for example for virtual goods, including 53 percent from games. And the rest comes from commerce, Lau said. Focusing on mobile hasn\u2019t paid off yet in revenue, Lau admitted. He cited growth in mobile advertising from Facebook and Twitter, but said that was less applicable for Tencent properties. Lau said he expects that eventually \u201cthe real value is the connection of the phone with businesses offline.\u201d To that end, Tencent has a very active platform for outside developers, with 400,000 registered apps and $500,000 worth of revenue shared with partners so far, Lau said. Many of those are game developers, but they also include Chinese equivalents of Uber, which are shaking up the local taxi industry, and are built within Weixin. What\u2019s next for Tencent is international expansion, and it\u2019s clear that the company is still figuring out how to do that, through a combination of investments and partnerships (mostly in games, but also in things like Fab.com ) and its own product development. For instance, Tencent built an international version of the Weixin mobile messaging app called WeChat, with slightly different code. Lau said WeChat has 100 million registered accounts. (We should flag that this is different from the other stats, as it\u2019s not active users.) How will Tencent break into the U.S.? That question seemed to flummox Lau a bit. It\u2019s clearly a pressing challenge, with no obvious answer. \u201cU.S.\u00a0is a very tough market, U.S. is about the toughest,\u201d Lau said. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0the source of innovation in the Internet industry. You have your free SMS which takes away the cost appeal of microchat. You have iMessage \u2026\u00a0We will try to find ways to provide differentiated services.\u201d For now, Lau said, WeChat is seeing great traction in Southeast Asia.", "lede": "Tencent\u2019s market cap passed $100 billion a few weeks ago.

Circa debuted almost a year ago on Apple devices, and is structured around factoids called \u201catomic units of news.\u201d These units may be plucked from one story and dropped into another in lieu of traditional context paragraphs like, er , this one. Readers who \u201cfollow\u201d a story get notified of new facts as they\u2019re added to that story. That\u2019s all still true, but now Circa is getting more aggressive about having an earlier role in the breaking-news cycle. While the old app only sent push notifications for stories readers had elected to follow, the new app will also push out breaking stories, encouraging more frequent use of the app and following of topics, since the meat of each story will still be unfolding. According to a company press release, when readers open one of these notifications, they will see whatever information is new to them first, \u201cand the rest of the storyline below.\u201d That storyline is constructed by Circa\u2019s human editors, who place the factoids in descending order of importance, or the \u201cinverted pyramid\u201d in journalist-speak. CEO Matt Galligan said in an email interview that, according to numbers provided by Flurry, Circa users currently spend 50 percent longer in the app than they do in other news apps. Among users who open the app more than once in a day, he added, more than half return twice. Galligan declined to disclose download numbers. According to Onavo Insights , in the past two months, the Circa News app has ping-ponged between the 30s and the 130s in the download rankings for the News section of the U.S. App Store. The hope is that adding breaking-news alerts will bring the app\u2019s user retention up some more.

A new filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Wednesday shows Apple alleging that some \u201cHighly Confidential \u2014 Attorneys\u2019 Eyes Only\u201d licensing agreements it provided to Samsung\u2019s outside counsel were given to the Korean company\u2019s executives. Those agreements described the terms of an Apple-Nokia patent license and were not to be shared with anyone beyond Samsung\u2019s legal team. But, according to Apple, they were. The company alleges that they somehow found their way, unredacted, into the hands of dozens of Samsung executives, including Dr. Seungho Ahn, who leveraged them during licensing negotiations with Nokia. From the filing: According to a declaration from Nokia\u2019s Chief Intellectual Property Officer, Paul Melin, on June 4, 2013, in a meeting between Samsung and Nokia licensing executives, Dr. Seungho Ahn informed Nokia that the terms of the Apple-Nokia license were known to him. Specifically, according to Mr. Melin, Dr. Ahn stated that Apple had produced the Apple-Nokia license in its litigation with Samsung, and that Samsung\u2019s outside counsel had provided his team with the terms of the Apple-Nokia license. Mr. Melin recounts that to prove to Nokia that he knew the confidential terms of the Apple-Nokia license, Dr. Ahn recited the terms of the license, and even went so far as to tell Nokia that \u201call information leaks.\u201d Mr. Melin also reports that Dr. Ahn and Samsung then proceeded to use his knowledge of the terms of the Apple- Nokia license to gain an unfair advantage in their negotiations with Nokia, by asserting that the Apple-Nokia terms should dictate terms of a Samsung-Nokia license. Shady stuff, if it\u2019s true \u2014 and troubling. U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal has ordered Samsung to make Ahn available for deposition, and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Oct. 22.

All of them come equipped with 1.6GHz quad-core processors, high-resolution IPS displays, dual-band WiFi, 8GB built-in storage, Bluetooth and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. The 8-inch model has a 1024 x 768 pixel resolution, the 9.7-inch has 2048 x 1536 and the 10.1 model has 1280 x 800. The smallest of the lot also only has 1GB of DDR3 RAM while the other two have 2GB each. As a bonus incentive, the 10.1 model is the only one with GPS and a 2-megapixel camera on the front; the rest have a 0.3-megapixel front-facing cam. Other specs that are the same across the three are a microUSB port, a 3.5mm headset jack, a microSD card slot, a mini HDMI output and a 2-megapixel rear camera. As is often the case with Archos, the prices are very competitive: the 8-inch model will retail for $199.99, the 9.7-inch for $269.99 and the 10.1-inch model for $299.99.

Previewed in June 2013 (see BIMMERPOST preview video below) and intended for off-road use only, the BMW M Laptimer App records data from a BMW Apps\u2013equipped vehicle's on-board network and GPS receiver to create comparative track sessions and provide essential performance information. It generates track maps and captures essential driving data including top speed, number of laps, best lap time and ambient temperature. Information is then presented on the scorecard screen when the vehicle is no longer in motion. The BMW M Laptimer provides highly visual depictions of throttle, speed, brake input, engine RPM, fuel level, and g-force. Users can easily zoom in and out, and rewind or fast forward through track recordings. BMW M Laptimer will automatically calculate laps and times for the user without the need for pre-installed track map data. The App can be used on virtually any closed circuit. A Comparison Mode gives users the ability to view individual or dual runs in real-time. Users can select their own laps or compare against a lap sent by another BMW driver. Users may also share track day results with friends to compare data. Additionally, users can post results through social media integration, including Facebook and Twitter.", "lede": "BMW Launches the BMW M Laptimer App Precise, real-time racing-sty...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/bmw-m-laptimer-goes-live-in-ios-app-store/"}, {"author": "Timothy J.

With the IPO, Twitter is looking to raise $1 billion on 472,613,753 shares of common stock, trading under the stock symbol TWTR. In the filing, the company also confirmed that it now has 218.3 million monthly active users (or MAUs) according to its most recent numbers, and that it pulled in $253.6 million in revenue for the six months ending June 30th, 2013, an increase of 107 percent from a year earlier. According to the company, mobile users unsurprisingly account for a particularly big chunk of its business, with 75 percent of its average MAUs accessing Twitter from a mobile device in the three months ending June 30, 2013, and mobile use accounting for 65 percent of its advertising revenue. It still isn't making a profit, though, with the company seeing a net loss of $69.3 million for the aforementioned six month period. That's compared to $316.9 million in revenue for all of 2012, and a net loss of $79.4 million. Of those 215 million MAUs, 49.2 million are in the United States, while 169.1 million are international, representing an increase of 35% and 47%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Beyond those numbers, the company has also revealed the number of Timeline views for the first time; they stood at 150.9 billion for the three months ending June 30th, and 287.2 billion for six months prior (up 69% and 79% from a year earlier). On average, that translates to 691 timeline views per MAU for the same three month period, although that number jumps a fair bit looking just at US Twitter users -- they rack up 825 timeline views on average. In a brief letter to shareholders included in the filing, the company says \"Twitter represents a service shaped by the people, for the people,\" and that \"the mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers,\" adding, \"our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve\u2013and do not detract from\u2013a free and global conversation.\" Those interested in digging into all of the numbers can find the full filing on the SEC's website . &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;", "lede": "&#13; Less than a month after announcing its plans for an IPO, Tw...", "link": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/03/twitter-ipo-stock-public-offering-shares/"}, {"author": "Brian Heater", "title": "Peripheral Vision 006: Shawn Campbell on starting a radio station with a computer and microphone", "feed_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 20:18:00", "content": "&#13; \"People sometimes say, 'oh, you're just like a real radio station,' \" Shawn Campbell begins with a smile. \"I have to say, 'we are a real radio station -- we're just one that doesn't have a broadcast signal yet.' \" Campbell is seated besides a mic in studio B of what does, indeed, look like a real radio station. I might have half-jokingly made a comment along those lines when we arrived -- one-hundred-plus years of terrestrial broadcasting is enough to instill one with certain preconceived notions about what, precisely, makes a radio station. Campbell launched Chicago-based CHIRP in 2007 with terrestrial radio dreams and a team of 75 volunteers. \"I'd had a couple of bad experiences in radio where I'd really poured my heart and soul into a station, only to have it thwarted by the owners,\" she explains. \"Initially we thought that we were going to have to wait to apply for a low-power FM federal broadcast license. We thought we were going to have to lobby and change the laws to be able to do that. But we were so engaged that after about six months, we thought there [was] no reason not to start as an online station and continue our work to increase access for low-power FM and eventually apply for a license.\" &#13; Perceived dial congestion has made it all but impossible for potential low-power stations to secure themselves a spot on the airwaves in a city like Chicago. Through the great democratizing of the internet, however, the CHIRP team has been able to realize many of its community-organized radio ambitions. \"It's pretty cheap and it's really easy,\" Campbell says. \"You don't have to be super tech savvy to start.

Research and development costs \u2014 which \u201cconsist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services\u201d \u2014 came to nearly $112 million during the first half of 2013, or 44 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue during that period. Naturally, Twitter expects both of cost of revenue and R&amp;D costs to rise year over year, although they will vary as a percentage of the company\u2019s total revenue. By way of comparison, Facebook\u2019s cost of revenue for the year\u2019s first six months was $878 million and it spent $637 million on R&amp;D. It spent $595 million on infrastructure during that time period. Facebook also brought in more than $3.2 billion in revenue during that timeframe, so its costs were considerably less as a percentage of total revenue. If there\u2019s anything to take away from this comparison, it might be that no matter your business, being a mega web company means spending a lot of money on engineers who can build cutting-edge products and software to run them on. And Twitter\u2019s engineers are keeping plenty busy .\u00a0Perhaps because of the nature of its business (which is to say it doesn\u2019t store untold petabytes of photos ), Twitter is still able to lease data center space, although its costs to run them might go down in the long term if were it to build its own like Facebook has done.", "lede": "Twitter doesn\u2019t have nearly the scalability concerns of its web p...", "link": "http://gigaom.com/2013/10/03/twitter-is-spending-more-and-less-on-tech-than-you-might-think/"}, {"author": "Ki Mae Heussner", "title": "Want to see Google Glass at work in the hospital?

He just thinks his work is more useful \u2014 and he\u2019s going to share his code with anyone who wants to see it. Along with a team of Stanford researchers that includes machine learning expert and Coursera co-founder Andrew Ng , Socher has developed a computer model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a sentence 85 percent of the time.\u00a0The previous state of the art for this task \u2014 essentially, discerning whether the overall tone of a sentence is positive or negative \u2014 peaked at about 80 percent accuracy. In a field where improvements usually come fractions of a percent at a time, that 5 percent jump is a big deal. It\u2019s also a big deal to businesses, which are trying harder than ever to automate the task of figuring out what people are saying about them online . Almost every tweet, review, blog post or other piece of content expresses an opinion, but employing a human being to scan every one and instigate some sort of response or enter them into a database isn\u2019t exactly efficient. Early approaches to sentiment analysis or social media monitoring have been kind of crude, often focusing on individual words that don\u2019t account for context at all. @derrickharris Thanks for being a Quiznos fan, Derrick! Here\u2019s a coupon to use on your next visit: http://t.co/yWS2wDlhi6 \u2014 Quiznos (@Quiznos) February 27, 2013 Socher\u2019s team pulled off its accomplishment by focusing not just on single words, but on entire sentences. It took nearly 11,000 sentences from online movie reviews (from research database culled from Rotten Tomatoes, specifically) and created what the team has dubbed the Sentiment Treebank. What makes the Sentiment Treebank so novel is that the team split those nearly 11,000 sentences into more than 215,000 individual phrases and then used human workers \u2014 via Amazon Mechanical Turk \u2014 to classify each phrase on a scale from \u201cvery negative\u201d to \u201cvery positive.\u201d The team then built a new model it calls a Recursive Neural Tensor Network (it\u2019s an evolution of existing models called Recursive Neural Networks ), which is what actually processes all the words and phrases to create numeric representations for them and calculate how they interact with one another. When you\u2019re dealing with text like movie reviews that contain linguistic intricacies, Socher explained, you need a model that can really understand how words play off each other to alter the meaning of sentences. The order in which they come, and what connects them, matters a lot. A simple example of what Socher means would be a sentence like \u201cThere are slow and repetitive parts, but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting.\u201d \u201cUsually,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat comes after the \u2018but\u2019 dominates what comes before the \u2018but,\u2019\u201d and that\u2019s something a model focusing on single words or even single phrases might not be able to pick up. A visual representation of how Socher\u2019s model breaks down sentences. That sample sentence and the visual representation actually come from a website Socher\u2019s team built to show off and help train its model. The site includes a link to the research paper, as as well a live demonstration of the model on whatever sentences people enter, and a tool for exploring the Sentiment Treebank to see how it has classified sentences containing specific words. The code for the model will be available for download on the site in late October. Over time and with more sample sentences, Socher thinks his model could reach upward of 95 percent accuracy, but it will never be completely perfect. This is because there are always certain word combinations, sentence structures and jargon that don\u2019t appear enough to let the model effectively determine patterns in how they\u2019re used. The movie review training set, for example, didn\u2019t include many emoticons, so Socher\u2019s team is working on adding them to its system. It also had to develop algorithms to analyze the morphology of words. For example, Socher noted, the word \u201cabsurdly\u201d is used infrequently, but an algorithm is able to figure out that adding \u201cly\u201d to a word doesn\u2019t create a wholly new word with different sentiment. The new model and Sentiment Treebank by Socher and his team come as deep learning is catching on more broadly, thanks in part to research that companies such as Google , Facebook and Microsoft (Socher is actually a Microsoft Research Ph.D. fellow) have been publicizing in fields such as image recognition (or\u00a0computer vision), speech recognition and even language understanding. Earlier this week, IBM announced a research partnership with four high-profile universities that focuses in part on deep learning. Socher acknowledged the impressive work done elsewhere, but he\u2019s not convinced there\u2019s much commercial utility in focusing too much on image recognition (at least right now) or on single words. (Google and others would probably disagree, maybe quite strongly, and probably could probably raise some very good points.) So he and\u00a0his Stanford colleagues have been focusing on phrases and sentences, and aside from sentiment analysis, he says their models are pushing the state of the art in areas such as machine translation , grammatical analysis and logical reasoning. \u201cYou\u2019ll never care about translating a single word to another single word,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201dWe\u2019re actually able to put whole sentences and longer phrases into vector spaces without ignoring the order of the words.\u201d", "lede": "Stanford Ph.D. student Richard Socher appreciates the work Google...", "link": "http://gigaom.com/2013/10/03/stanford-researchers-to-open-source-model-they-say-has-nailed-sentiment-analysis/"}, {"author": "Kevin Fitchard", "title": "TextNow brings its all-IP mobile service to the Galaxy SIII and LTE", "feed_title": "GigaOM", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 21:38:56", "content": "TextNow became the first all-IP mobile operator in the country in August when it started selling a $19 plan and two Android phones that relied solely on Sprint\u2019s data networks to deliver voice and messaging services.

On Thursday it began selling the Samsung Galaxy SIII embedded with an LTE chip, giving it access to much faster data speeds a much better mobile VoIP experience.

In the three years that Dhir has joined Apple, he spearheaded efforts to push Apple products in the Indian market by boosting the network of Apple-exclusive stores, shortening the time span between the launch of new models overseas and in India, and expanded the Indian team threefold to more than 150 executives. Last year,\u00a0 Apple\u00a0turned to independent distributors \u00a0to sell its iPhone throughout the country, as the lack of\u00a0carrier subsidies limited adoption in India.\u00a0Apple has also reportedly been keen to\u00a0 push its iPhone in India \u00a0with more advertising as well as numerous discount schemes and monthly installment options. The company quietly launched the iPhone 5 in India in\u00a0 November last year . Next up for Apple in India: it wants to blaze its way into smaller cities and towns through its iPhones, iPads and iPods, as the population in these smaller markets is becoming richer and youths are aspiring toward Apple products. Apple is targeting 100 exclusive standalone stores under the franchisee model in these smaller Indian markets, and is seeking to roll them out this fiscal year, executives at a closed-door meeting hosting by Apple India told the Economic Times. India is a market with lots of potential According to figures from research firm Canalys in August, India managed to snag third place in worldwide smartphone shipments in Q2 2013, thanks to rapid growth of 129 percent to hit 9.0 million. It is little wonder that besides increasing its efforts to appeal to Chinese consumers, Apple also wants a slice of the pie in India. Apple CEO Tim Cook\u00a0said during a Q3 2013 earnings call in July that\u00a0iPhone sales in India during the quarter were up 400 percent year-on-year, while the\u00a0iPad posted double-digit unit growth in India in the same period. However, the increasing threat from low-cost manufacturers in these countries is a problem for Apple.\u00a0Canalys noted back in August that the only international vendor to really succeed in India was Samsung. Local vendors have been doing well in the price-conscious Indian market instead.\u00a0One of them is Micromax,\u00a0a handset manufacturer that has been\u00a0 threatening to tip Samsung off its leadership position \u00a0in the Indian smartphone market. Another one is\u00a0Karbonn, which was the third-ranked handset manufacturer in India during Q2 2013 according to IDC, with a market share of 13 percent.

Ars Technica made the discovery , and has a comprehensive account of the difference it made. In basic terms, this means Samsung has adjusted\u00a0the phone so that it recognizes benchmarking software and knows to run flat-out when it is being put through its paces. Benchmarking is commonly used by many tech media and analysts as a way to compare devices, showing which phones or tablets perform fastest across various categories and settings. Many critics are calling Samsung\u2019s actions cheating because the Note 3 does not run this fast in \u2018real world\u2019 conditions \u2014 it has battery-saving software and over-heating safeguards that kick in and prevent it from over-performing with any single app or activity. Their argument is that Samsung and others \u2014 for the company is not alone in benchmark optimizing \u2013\u00a0do this so that their devices score better in the tests, garners more impressive media coverage and are thus more attractive to those who are looking to buy a smartphone. But here\u2019s the thing, the storm being whipped up about this issue is totally overblown. User experience comes first Yes, Samsung is being deceitful to a point, but it\u2019s not like the scores are artificial or entirely fake, as they come from the device itself.\u00a0A more pertinent issue here is really how much emphasis is placed upon data, as people elevate the importance of benchmarking in particular I\u2019m not saying that benchmarking isn\u2019t a worthy pursuit, but its significance is too often overemphasized \u2014 perhaps by us technology geeks in the media, or those who like charts and statistical comparisons. The fact remains that a phone is about the user experience, and switching a few settings to generate \u201csmall gains in performance\u201d \u2014 to quote Anandtech \u2014 is really besides the issue. Support for apps, a fluid user experience, the potential to upgrade, price and plenty of other user-focused metrics are far more important and worthy of consideration when deciding on the quality of a phone \u2014 as TNW\u2019s own Nick Summers pointed out last week . To put it another way. Most people don\u2019t shop for a car based on its top speed, we look for things that will impact (or help) our daily lives. Yet you wouldn\u2019t criticize Toyota, Nissan, BMW and others for listing a car\u2019s top speed despite the fact that 99 percent of customers will never get to drive it that fast. The speed is pretty much irrelevant to the purchasing decision or any media review. The same logic should be applied to benchmarking. This is the domain of enthusiasts and statisticians, not everyday consumers. Everyone is \u2018cheating\u2019 Finally, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Samsung \u2014 which was found to have optimized the Galaxy S4 for benchmarking this summer \u2014 isn\u2019t alone in doing what it does. Anandtech notes that\u00a0\u2019cheating\u2019 is pretty much rife within the industry: With the exception of Apple and Motorola, literally every single OEM we\u2019ve worked with ships (or has shipped) at least one device that runs this silly CPU optimization. It\u2019s possible that older Motorola devices might\u2019ve done the same thing, but none of the newer devices we have on hand exhibited the behavior. It\u2019s a systemic problem that seems to have surfaced over the last two years, and one that extends far beyond Samsung. Were the issue to affect real-world testing, then it would be more serious. However, it\u2019s not clear how that would work,\u00a0and, in my opinion, that is a very different reality to wanting to showcase a device\u2019s optimal performance in benchmark testing, which is purely performance-oriented. For what it\u2019s worth, Samsung has denied \u00a0the accusations, claiming that \u201cthe\u00a0Galaxy Note 3 maximizes its CPU/GPU frequencies when running features that demand substantial performance.\u201d Images via\u00a0 vesna cvorovic \u00a0/ Shutterstock, Thinkstock", "lede": "Samsung is currently under fire for optimizing its newest devices...", "link": "http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2013/10/04/samsungs-benchmark-rigging-proves-we-need-a-better-way-to-judge-smartphone-performance/"}, {"author": "Jon Russell", "title": "Zynga founder Pincus says he was misquoted and is only bored of the \u2018current crop\u2019 of games", "feed_title": "The Next Web", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 06:19:30", "content": "Zynga founder Mark Pincus has responded to suggestions that he is fed up \u00a0with the gaming industry by claiming he has been misquoted and taken out of context.

(The company has since appealed the ruling.) Kaleidescape makes home theater machines\u2014devices that can keep all of your DVD and Blu-ray\u00a0movies in a single location and play them without the hassle of digging through DVD cases to find the right disc. The thing that sticks out about Kaleidescape is that its home theater boxes aren't small. These are typically enormous devices that cost many thousands of dollars, and the boxes are more likely to be installed by a home theater contractor than by a normal consumer. Any self-respecting home theater geek these days likely already has a setup designed to do something similar. This usually takes the form of a home theater PC running XBMC or one of its variants , with video and music stored either on internal storage or connected to a NAS over Ethernet. Doing this will get you a system that does most of the things Kaleidescape's boxes do, but the DIY route comes with the added hassle of installing and maintaining your own software. You also need to acquire a working knowledge of disc ripping and encoding, a task that isn't terribly difficult \u00a0but isn't terribly easy\u00a0 either. Kaleidescape's systems automate a significant chunk of the HTPC experience, wrapping the movie ripping and storage aspect in a single attractive package that looks and functions more like an appliance than an HTPC. The company's traditional products, as mentioned, are expensive \u2014like, $10,000-type expensive. They're great for an upmarket customer who wants to wire every room in his or her vacation home up for movie watching, but it's not a great option for the more middle-class among us. The Cinema One is Kaleidescape's attempt at moving a bit down the market. The system still isn't anywhere near approaching \"cheap,\" but it is significantly less expensive than previous Kaleidescape offerings. A Cinema One will set you back about $3,000. Expense is relative, but that's still a heart-stopping chunk of change. For that amount of money, though, you get an awesome home theater system that stores hundreds of movies and can access hundreds more online. It's a great little box, but is it worth it? That depends. Let's dive in. Unboxing and physicality The Cinema One arrived tucked away neatly inside its box, along with an accessory kit containing a very normal-looking infrared remote control with batteries, a power brick and cord, an Ethernet cable, an HDMI cable, and a tiny USB 802.11n Wi-Fi adapter. It's gratifying to see the cables and the Wi-Fi adapter already included. Considering the device's price, their absence would be inexcusable. Lee Hutchinson The Kaleidescape Cinema One's box, unopened. Lee Hutchinson The Kaleidescape Cinema One's box, unopened. Lee Hutchinson The box includes a big quick-start guide with lots of movies on it. Lee Hutchinson The Quick Start guide is quite helpful and includes info on setting up the Cinema One's remote to control your TV and other AV gear. Lee Hutchinson The accessory box contains a remote control with batteries; cables for power, Ethernet, and HDMI; and an 802.11n Wi-Fi USB dongle. There's a large fold-out poster stuck atop the accessory kit showing how to get the system up and running quickly. This includes details on how to program the remote to control your television, receiver, and other things in your A/V stack. The system is designed to look exactly like a DVD or Blu-ray\u00a0player. Its dimensions mirror those of a typical player, and it has a pleasant clutter-free white plastic bezel with a disc slot, a light-up logo (which dims during movie playback), and a trio of buttons. Those buttons allow you to eject a disc, rip the disc's contents to your library, and power the system on and off. The system's casing is metal and quite sturdy; the entire thing weighs about 10 lbs (4.6 kg). The port layout on the back of the unit is as pleasingly sparse as its front bezel\u2014from left to right, there's a power plug, an HDMI port, analog audio output ports, a digital audio coax output port, a USB port (for the Wi-Fi dongle), a gigabit Ethernet port, and a small plug for connecting an additional infrared receiver.

The Indonesian government and Freeport blamed the killings on a separatist group, the Free Papua Movement, which had been fighting a low-level guerrilla war for several decades. I opened my article with this sentence: \"Bush Administration officials have determined that Indonesian soldiers carried out a deadly ambush that killed two American teachers.\" I also reported that two FBI agents had travelled to Indonesia to assist in the inquiry and quoted a \"senior administration official\" as saying there \"was no question there was a military involvement.'' The story prompted a leak investigation. The FBI sought to obtain my phone records and those of Jane Perlez, the Times bureau chief in Indonesia and my wife. They also went after the records of the Washington Post reporters in Indonesia who had published the first reports about the Indonesian government's involvement in the killings. As part of its investigation, the FBI asked for help from what is described in a subsequent government report as an \"on-site communications service\" provider. The report, by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, offers only the vaguest description of this key player, calling it \"Company A.'' \"We do not identify the specific companies because the identities of the specific providers who were under contract with the FBI for specific services are classified,'' the report explained. Whoever they were, Company A had some impressive powers. Through some means\u2014the report is silent on how\u2014Company A obtained records of calls made on Indonesian cell phones and landlines by the Times and Post reporters. The records showed whom we called, when, and for how long\u2014what has now become famous as \" metadata .\" Under DOJ rules, the FBI investigators were required to ask the attorney general to approve a grand jury subpoena before requesting records of reporters' calls. But that's not what happened. Instead, the bureau sent Company A what is known as an \" exigent letter '' asking for the metadata. A heavily redacted version of the DOJ report , released in 2010, noted that exigent letters are supposed to be used in extreme circumstances where there is no time to ask a judge to issue a subpoena. The report found nothing \"exigent'' in an investigation of several three-year-old newspaper stories. The need for an exigent letter suggests two things about Company A. First, that it was an American firm subject to American laws. Second, that it had come to possess my records through lawful means and needed legal justification to turn them over to the government. The report disclosed that the agents' use of the exigent letter was choreographed by the company and the bureau. It said the FBI agent drafting the letter received \"guidance\" from \"a Company A analyst.'' According to the report, lawyers for Company A and the bureau worked together to develop the approach. Not surprisingly, \"Company A\" quickly responded to the letter it helped write. In fact, it was particularly generous, supplying the FBI with records covering a 22-month period, even though the bureau's investigation was limited to a seven-month period. Altogether, \"Company A\" gave the FBI metadata on 1,627 calls by me and the other reporters. Only three calls were within the seven-month window of phone conversations investigators had decided to review. It doesn't end there. The DOJ\u00a0report asserts that \"the FBI made no investigative use of the reporters' telephone records.\" But I don't believe that is accurate. In 2007, I heard rumblings that the leak investigation was focusing on a diplomat named Steve Mull, who was the deputy chief of mission in Indonesia at the time of the killings. I had known Mull when he was a political officer in Poland and I was posted there in the early 1990s. He is a person of great integrity and a dedicated public servant. The DOJ\u00a0asked to interview me. Of course, I would not agree to help law enforcement officials identify my anonymous sources. But I was troubled because I felt an honorable public servant had been forced to spend money on lawyers to fend off a charge that was untrue. After considerable internal debate, I decided to talk to the DOJ\u00a0for the limited purpose of clearing Mull. It was not a decision I could make unilaterally. The Times also had a stake in this. If I allowed myself to be interviewed, how could the Times say no the next time the government wanted to question a Times reporter about a leak? The Times lawyer handling this was George Freeman, a journalist's lawyer, a man Times reporters liked having in their corner. George and the DOJ\u00a0lawyers began to negotiate over my interview. Eventually, we agreed that I would speak on two conditions: one, that they could not ask me for the name of my source; and two, if they asked me if it was \u2018X,' and I said no, they could not then start going through other names. Freeman and I sat across a table from two DOJ\u00a0lawyers. I'm a lawyer, and I prided myself on being able to answer their questions with ease, never having to turn to Freeman for advice. Until that is, one of the lawyers took a sheaf of papers that was just off to his right and began asking me about phone calls I made to Mull. One call was for 19 minutes, the DOJ\u00a0lawyer said, giving me the date and time. I asked for a break to consult with Freeman. We came back and answered questions about the phone calls. I said that I couldn't remember what these calls were about\u2014it had been more than four years earlier\u2014but that Mull had not given me any information about the killings. Per our agreement, the DOJ\u00a0lawyers did not ask further questions about my sources, and the interview ended. I didn't know how the DOJ\u00a0had gotten my phone records, but I assumed the Indonesian government had provided them. Then, about a year later, I received a letter from the FBI's general counsel, Valerie Caproni who wrote that my phone records had been taken from \"certain databases\" under the authority of an \"exigent letter,'' (a term I had never heard). Caproni sent similar letters to Perlez, to the Washington Post reporters, and to the executive editors of the Post and the Times, Leonard Downie and Bill Keller, respectively. In addition, FBI Director Robert Mueller called Downie and Keller, according to the report. Caproni wrote that the records had not been seen by anyone other than the agent requesting them and that they had been expunged from all databases. I'm uneasy because the DOJ\u00a0report makes clear that the FBI is still concealing some aspect of this incident. After describing Caproni's letters, the report says, \"However, the FBI did not disclose to the reporters or their editors that [BLACKED OUT].\" The thick black lines obliterate what appear to be several sentences. If you were to ask senior intelligence officials whether I should wonder about those deletions, they'd probably say no. I'm not so sure. The government learned extensive details about my personal and professional life. Most of those calls were about other stories I was writing. Some were undoubtedly to arrange my golf game with the Australian ambassador. Is he now under suspicion? The report says the data has been destroyed and that only two analysts ever looked at it. But who is this 'Company A\" that willingly cooperated with the government? Why was it working hand in glove with the FBI? And what did the FBI director not tell the editors of the Times and the Washington Post when he called them acknowledging that the government had improperly obtained reporter's records?

Still, it seems much more realistic when you see the fully navigable, 3D virtual reality version of Mars that Norris and other JPL researchers have already created using funding from NASA's Game Changing Development program and some technology originally designed for more realistic gaming. While it's pretty awe-inspiring to be able to look at the surface of another world through panoramic photos or IMAX movies , a flat image is not exactly the best way to study the surface of another planet. \"If you're looking at a panoramic image on a flat monitor... you might think that something's to your right that's actually behind you, because you're looking at a rolled out picture,\" Norris pointed out. \"Or you might zoom in on something and think 'Oh, that's significantly to the right of me.' But because you're zoomed in so far, it might just be a couple of degrees to your right, because you don't have the reference points on Mars.\" That's part of why JPL has been looking into ways to let researchers and members of the public experience the data it's getting from Mars more naturally. In the past, the team has looked into room-sized \"surround theaters\" that project images from the Martian surface on the floors, walls, and ceilings, ensconcing users in a Martian environment. These installations are comfortable, but also quite expensive. They also require users to make a special trip to use them. For a more portable home or office-based simulation, the team turned to gaming technologies to make navigating more intuitive and effective. \"We're always watching the market for new devices that are potentially useful for work,\" Norris said. \"We like working with video game technologies because they're designed to be very accessible for people. They also tend to be very low cost.\" Norris seems particularly excited about the team's current research, which combines an HD prototype of the Oculus Rift head-mounted display with Vicon's Bonita position tracking system . Users can actually walk and look around a simulation of the Martian surface, as shown in a video the team released today. The people behind the Oculus are excited as well. \u201cVirtual reality is immediately useful as a way to get people excited about space again, and as the hardware advances, it will become a powerful tool for real research and exploration,\" Oculus CEO Palmer Luckey told Ars. \"In particular, virtual reality based telepresence\u00a0could allow human operators to perform tasks in hostile environments without actually going there themselves. For many use scenarios, the dexterity and locomotion capabilities of a human piloted robot will surpass what a real person in a spacesuit can do. JPL has some amazing stuff in the pipeline that is going to have a big impact on mankind. It makes me very happy to see people using virtual reality and the Rift for the greater good.\" Virtual Mars JPL's simulation of the Martian surface is put together by taking a panoramic parallax image sent by a Martian rover and stitching it together onto the surface of a virtual cylinder about 50 square meters (164 square feet) in base area. Researchers then superimpose 3D point cloud data gathered by the rover on top of the scene, creating a series of meshes called \"surflets\" that give the impression of depth. The result, as you see in the video, is a fully explorable, accurate 3D slice of the Martian surface sent to Earth from hundreds of thousands of miles away. \"When you consider all of the data that Curiosity has acquired, plus Opportunity and Spirit, we have hundreds of these sites,\" JPL Human Interfaces Software Engineer Victor Luo told Ars. Being inside a 3D virtual Mars is undoubtedly cool, but it also has important applications as a research tool, Norris said. Using the Oculus Rift, researchers can study the data sent by Curiosity just as they would view the world around them\u2014by moving their heads and walking around. Norris said that using these natural human abilities to engage with different environments is key to making them more effective explorers in a strange world. \"Think about how amazing of an ability every human has to extract vast amount of information from the environment just by being present in it,\" Norris said. \"Then you consider that geologists and other scientists build on those abilities with specialized training and field work and things like that. But then we ask them to go and explore the planet by peering at flat images on ordinary computer monitors and so on. We have some evidence that this makes our natural abilities work against us rather than for us. This project is about correcting that.\" Adding the Vicon motion tracker to the setup gives researchers another ability they don't easily have with flat pictures of the Martian surface: the ability to walk around and examine bits that interest them up close. \"If you're looking at pictures taken by the robot, you're kind of frozen where the robot is,\" Norris said. \"We want people to be able to get up and move around in that space.\" More than just locomotion, though, Norris said the motion tracker adds verisimilitude via the \"little motions\" humans make when looking around, such as shifting a shoulder or leaning the neck to one side. This kind of parallax motion is a key way that humans and other animals assess depth and distance in their environment, and it allows for a much more accurate impression of the user's virtual Martian surroundings. Enlarge / This might not look that impressive on your flat computer screen, but just wait until you can experience it on an HD head-mounted display. This is all useful for researchers on the ground trying to form scientific hypotheses about the Martian landscape, of course. But Norris sees this kind of technology being used by the operators navigating Martian rovers, letting them \"be more informed and better aware of the environment of the robot, what we call the morphology of the environment\u2014what's it shaped like, where are the rocks, what orientation are they, how are they arranged. When you're driving a robot around on another planet, it's important to know what the environment right around it is...\" he said. The future As impressive as the working prototype JPL has up and running is, it's very much a first draft of the kind of virtual reality environments the lab hopes to create. In the future, JPL researchers are looking to integrate other data to make the virtual Martian environment more detailed, including data from lower-resolution orbital photos and true-color rover \"Mastcams\" that generate much higher spatial resolution when zoomed in. The model may even eventually integrate data from wide-field, close-mounted \"hazard cameras\" that were designed to monitor the area immediately surrounding the rovers' treads and robotic arm for safety. Researchers are also looking to increase immersion by adding Martian audio to the simulation, despite a lack of direct sound measurement on the planet itself. \"We don't have a microphone on Mars, so we don't know exactly what it sounds like, but we can model it,\" Norris said. \"Curiosity has a weather station. We know how hard the wind is blowing, we know the atmospheric pressure, we could render the audio in a very convincing way... It should sound like a high whistling.\" As for the user interface, the researchers are looking into adding some kind of accurate hand-tracking to let users reach out and interact with the virtual Martian soil. \"The interaction language inside of a virtual reality environment is kind of non-defined,\" Luo said. \"Using a joystick really doesn't make that much sense when you're on Mars. How would you navigate in that environment? ... Is there some other kind of hardware that could be attached or installed to help with that?\" Norris said the JPL team has experimented with hand-tracking solutions ranging from the LeapMotion and Kinect to the Razer Hydra and accelerometer-based gloves, but no option has really provided the perfect combination of accurate tracking, mobility, and light encumbrance on the hands. Still, he's hopeful that the game industry might help him out on this score in the near future. \"One of the things we love about working in this area is that there are a lot of companies that are attacking these problems for a lot of reasons\u2014video games, entertainment\u2014but we'll benefit as well,\" he said. While JPL is still long way off from releasing its virtual Mars in a way that the public can enjoy, Norris said that \"making it possible for the public to join us on the surface of these distant worlds in a way that feels much more real than looking at a picture on a screen we think is of great importance and really exciting.\" And there's always that eventual goal of letting the world experience the first steps on Martian soil in a holodeck-like environment, of course. \"I think those kinds of events, those kinds of explorations in the future, need to be experienced by our whole civilization, and these technologies are how we can make that happen,\" Norris said. \"It's how we can be a part of that in a way that's so much more real than anything that's ever been available to us before.\"", "lede": "He's not really on Mars... but in a way, he kind of is. \"My dream...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/10/how-gaming-tech-is-making-for-better-interplanetary-exploration/"}, {"author": "Joe Mullin", "title": "Key Senator wants to ban bulk surveillance, leading to Democratic showdown", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 19:45:10", "content": "NSA leaks View all\u2026 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) expressed support yesterday for serious surveillance reform, saying he will introduce legislation that calls for an end to the National Security Agency's (NSA) mass dragnet of phone data.

However, Leahy\u2014the chairman of the judiciary committee\u2014is clearly in a powerful position from which to move such a bill forward. In the Senate, it's going to be a serious Democrat-on-Democrat battle, since the chairman of the Senate's top intelligence committee, Diane Feinstein (D-CA), has made it clear she will fight such a bill. At a hearing yesterday, Feinstein said the bulk data collection could prevent another event like the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \u201cI will do everything I can to prevent this program from being canceled out\u2026to destroy it is to make this nation more vulnerable,\" said Feinstein,\u00a0according to a Politico\u00a0 report \u00a0on the hearing. The justification for bulk data collection was \"strained at best,\" said Leahy. He doesn't believe the position of the intelligence community that the bulk data program stopped 54 terrorist plots, citing \"inaccurate\" reports from the Obama Administration. \"That\u2019s plainly wrong. These weren\u2019t all plots, and they weren\u2019t all thwarted,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because something is technologically possible, and just because something may be deemed technically legal, does not mean that it is the right thing to do,\" Leahy added. It isn't clear how many senators on the committee would support Leahy's position. Support could come from conservative Republicans on the committee like Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), but neither voiced their positions yesterday, according to Politico. Democrats called for reform but were more focused on smaller measures, like adding an advocate to the FISC. Leahy is working together with politicians pushing an identical bill in the House, where the idea of banning bulk data collection is drawing important supporters like the Republican head of House Judiciary oversight, Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). (Sensenbrenner co-authored the PATRIOT Act). According to Politico, the ranking Democratic member of House Judiciary John Conyers (D-MI) is also a supporter.

NSA leaks View all\u2026 Three United Kingdom-based nonprofit organizations and a German Internet activist have filed a lawsuit against the British government at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), arguing that the UK's electronic spying network is illegal. Documents provided by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden have shown that the UK\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the sister organization to the NSA, has been one of the most prominent players in digital surveillance, particularly of European traffic. The lawsuit was filed Thursday at the ECHR in Strasbourg, France by Big Brother Watch, Open Rights Group, English PEN, and Constanze Kurz , who has been a longtime spokesperson for the Chaos Computer Club, a well-known German hacker group. \u201cBeyond effective legal scrutiny\u201d In the 67-page filing, the appellants argue that the communications interception is in direct violation of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights , Europe\u2019s rough analog to the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Unlike the Fourth Amendment, however,\u00a0 Article 8 specifically carves out a national security exception. It states: Article 8 \u2013 Right to respect for private and family life 1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. In their filing , the appellants argue that because the newly revealed data collection is \u201cindiscriminate,\u201d it cannot possibly be \u201csubject to any sufficiently precise or ascertainable legal framework and is beyond effective legal scrutiny.\u201d More precisely: In effect, the power to obtain and use external communications data by means of intercept is unfettered in published law, as long as it is thought broadly to be in the interests of [national] security or other of the specified generic purpose. There are no adequate criteria by which a court of tribunal could assess the legality of use of any particular intercept material even if the courts had jurisdiction to do so, which they do not. Holding the powerful accountable Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said in a statement that British laws have been interpreted far more broadly than how they originally were intended. \u201cThe laws governing how Internet data is accessed were written when barely anyone had broadband access and were intended to cover old-fashioned copper telephone lines,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament did not envisage or intend those laws to permit scooping up details of every communication we send, including content, so it\u2019s absolutely right that GCHQ is held accountable in the courts for its actions.\u201d The court, which is composed of 47 judges from each of the member states of the Council of Europe, may take months (or years) to render a decision. However, this case likely will be heard by a smaller committee composed of three or seven judges. The ECHR\u2019s own flow chart shows a long process (PDF) that likely awaits this application, along with the 50,000 other new applications that it receives each year. \u201cThe timetable is for the court, but I would hope for the case to be formally communicated to the UK within a couple of months,\u201d Daniel Carey, the chief solicitor in the case, told Ars. \u201cThereafter, they are likely to have two to three months for their response before the court considers next steps.

Texas Instruments said that with the TRE's 1GHz processor, it is the \"most powerful Arduino to date\" and the first that will be able to run \"full Linux.\" It will be available in spring 2014 from arduino.cc and other distributors, with pricing not yet announced. \"For the first time ever, Arduino users can use the full capabilities of Linux and gain access to a variety of new on-board connectivity options to develop a range of powerful, advanced applications while leveraging the simplicity of the Arduino software experience,\" the Texas Instruments announcement said. \"The Sitara-processor-powered Arduino TRE serves as a network hub that can connect to millions of classic Arduino nodes, enabling customers to be at the forefront of the Internet-of-Things era.\" This also removes the requirement for Arduino to be programmed with a separate PC. \"Arduino users no longer need a PC, but can access the full capabilities of Linux as well as a variety of connectivity options, including Ethernet, XBee wireless radios, USB and CAN,\" Texas Instruments said. \"As a result, users can implement more advanced applications with high-resolution LCD displays, hardware-accelerated 3D graphics and increased connectivity. The AM335x processor also includes two on-chip 200 MHz 32-bit Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) microcontrollers, which can be used for innumerable real-time applications including motor control and pulse width modulation.\" Arduino released its own announcement, saying the TRE will provide \"up to 100 times more performance\" than the Arduino Leonardo or Uno . \"This performance opens the doors to more advanced Linux-powered applications. The Sitara-processor-based Linux Arduino can run high-performance desktop applications, processing-intensive algorithms, or high-speed communications,\" Arduino said. The announcement did not provide a direct comparison to the Arduino Due , which is a year old and was the first ARM-based Arduino with an ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. Arduino also did not compare the TRE's performance to the new Arduino Galileo, which has a 400MHz Intel Quark processor, or say whether Galileo will be able to run Linux as well. We've asked Arduino for further details. ( UPDATE : Intel has answered this question, saying in an FAQ , \"Intel Galileo runs Linux out of the box. It comes in two flavors; the default is a small Linux. If you add an SD card to your kit, you can add a more fully-featured Linux.\" Thanks to commenter MrPippy for pointing this out. ) The TRE is actually \"two Arduinos in one,\" the \"Sitara-processor-based Linux Arduino, plus a full AVR-based (Atmel microcontroller) Arduino, while leveraging the simplicity of the Arduino software experience,\" Arduino's announcement said. \"The integration of the AVR Arduino enables the Arduino TRE to use the existing shield ecosystem so that innovators can expand the Arduino TRE to develop a wide range of high-performance applications such as 3D printers, gateways for building automation and lighting automation, telemetry hubs that collect data from nearby sensors wirelessly, and other connected applications that require host control plus real-time operations.\" Arduino designed the TRE in partnership with one of its ostensible rivals, the BeagleBoard.org foundation . The TRE is also the first Arduino board manufactured in the US. Previous Arduinos were made in Italy. Despite now using both Intel and ARM processors, Arduino isn't giving up on the Atmel microcontrollers that have historically powered its products. Arduino said it is working with Atmel on future products.", "lede": "The Arduino TRE.

Photograph by Kyle Orland Today's high-definition game consoles can be big power drainers, drawing around 70 to 100 Watts when in active use (depending on the model). That's down from over 170W of energy draw when the systems were first launched, thanks to firmware updates and hardware redesigns. Still, it can be quite a lot of energy, especially when the systems are being used for relatively simple things like Netflix streaming (an Apple TV, for comparison, only uses about 6W of power, and a Super Nintendo uses only 10W). The energy situation seems poised to improve with the next generation of consoles, though, according to a Polygon report . Systems like the Xbox One were \"designed from the ground up to maximize computational power per watt,\" according to Microsoft Senior Compliance Manager Tim Calland. The Xbox One's scalable multicore design is key to that efficiency, he said. \"One major difference we have now versus the Xbox 360 is scalable architecture, which means that it deals with tasks by just using the amount of computing capacity needed for the work to be done. Gaming is the big high-power experience, but when we are doing lesser functionality like streaming media, we're using much less energy than the Xbox 360 did when we launched... We have eight cores now and we only use the amount that we need. That wasn't an option in the last generation.\" Even when running at full capacity, Calland said that the Xbox One generates \"eight times the computational power for the same amount of energy as Xbox 360 at launch.\" Of course, the Xbox One has a much higher ceiling for computational power than the Xbox 360 did, so the overall energy consumption for players upgrading is still likely to see a bump. Still, there's room for that efficiency to improve over the console's lifetime, just as it did with the current generation of consoles. Calland also confirmed that the Xbox One will be set to shut down after 60 minutes of idle time by default, just like the Wii U. Even though that setting can be overridden by users, turning it on by default can have a surprisingly large effect on a console's aggregate lifetime power consumption.", "lede": "The mess of cables and power bricks required to power my home ent...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/multicore-design-makes-next-generation-consoles-more-energy-efficient/"}, {"author": "Ars Staff", "title": "How the feds took down the Dread Pirate Roberts", "feed_title": "Ars Technica", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 05:00:25", "content": "If you've been living under a cultural rock the Dread Pirate Roberts was a character from the cult film The Princess Bride (based upon the book of the same name). Aurich Lawson / ACT III Communications The Silk Road bust View all\u2026 The Dread Pirate Roberts, head of the most brazen drug trafficking site in the world, was a walking contradiction. Though the government says he raked in $80 million in commissions from running Silk Road, he allegedly lived under a false name in one bedroom of a San Francisco home that he shared with two other guys and for which he paid $1,000 a month in cash. Though his alleged alter ego penned manifestos about ending \"violence, coercion, and all forms of force,\" the FBI claims that he tried to arrange a hit on someone who had blackmailed him. And though he ran a site widely assumed to be under investigation by some of the most powerful agencies in the US government, the Dread Pirate Robert appears to have been remarkably sloppy \u2014so sloppy that the government finally put a name to the peg leg: Ross William Ulbricht. Yesterday, Ulbricht left his apartment to visit the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco Public Library in the southern part of the city. Library staff did not recognize him as a regular library patron, but they thought nothing of his visit as he set up his laptop in the science fiction section of the stacks. Then, at 3:15pm, staffers heard a \"crashing sound\" from the sci-fi collection and went to investigate, worried that a patron had fallen. Instead, library Communications Director Michelle Jeffers tells us that the staff came upon \"six to eight\" FBI agents arresting Ulbricht and seizing his laptop. The agents had tailed him, waiting for the 29-year-old to open his computer and enter his passwords before swooping in. They marched him out of the library without incident. For a promising young physics student from Austin, Texas, this wasn't how things were supposed to turn out. Ulbricht, in happier times. \u201cChoose freedom over tyranny\u201d Sure, you could buy meth, LSD, cannabis, heroin, and MDMA on the Silk Road, but the hidden website wasn't (just) about drugs. Silk Road was, said its owner, about freedom. In January 2012, as part of a \"State of the Road Address\" posted in the site's discussion forum, the Dread Pirate Roberts explained the site's goal: \"To grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.\" To that end, the Dread Pirate Roberts built the Silk Road marketplace in 2011 as a \"hidden\" service accessible only over the encrypted Tor network. To connect, users first had to install a Tor client and then visit a series of arcane site names (the most recent was silkroadfb5piz3r.onion), but the reward was a simple, effective marketplace to buy drugs from sellers all over the world using such Internet commerce staples as escrow accounts and buyer feedback. The product was shipped through the mail, direct from seller to buyer, keeping the Dread Pirate Roberts clean. The only link between him and the drugs was the money, and Roberts eventually took only the electronic currency called Bitcoin to make this hard to trace. He even ran a program called a \"tumbler\" to route incoming Bitcoin payments through a complicated series of dummy transactions, so as to make them infeasible to trace through the public Bitcoin blockchain. Out of each transaction, Roberts took a cut\u20148 to 15 percent, depending on the size of the sale. This eventually earned Roberts a pirate's treasure. By 2013, Silk Road had nearly one million user accounts. In the 2.5 years the site operated, it facilitated 1.2 million transactions worth 9.5 million Bitcoins\u2014or about $1.2 billion in total money exchanged. (Bitcoin values varied widely over this period.) Roberts picked up a cool $80 million in commissions. No surprise, then, that the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and the FBI all joined forces to track down Roberts and the largest sellers on his marketplace. In November 2011, after coming under pressure from Congress, the agencies began the hunt and quickly found that Roberts had been right\u2014encryption, Tor, and \"tumbled\" Bitcoins were a potent combination to crack. Ulbricht at his 21st birthday party. But investigations always have many threads to pull. The feds couldn't initially follow the money to Roberts, nor could they find the physical location of his cloaked servers. In the absence of usual digital clues, the feds fell back on a low-tech approach: keep going back in time until you find the first guy to ever talk about the Silk Road. Find that guy and you probably have a person of interest, if not Roberts himself. So they looked, assigning one agent to conduct \"an extensive search of the Internet,\" in the FBI's words, looking for early Silk Road publicity. The earliest post ever to mention the site appeared on a drug-oriented forum called shroomery.org, where a user named \"altoid\" had made a single post . It read: I came across this website called Silk Road. It's a Tor hidden service that claims to allow you to buy and sell anything online anonymously. I'm thinking of buying off it, but wanted to see if anyone here had heard of it and could recommend it. The post directed readers to visit silkroad420.wordpress.com, belonging to the blogging operator WordPress, where further instructions would be found for accessing the real Silk Road site. A subpoena to WordPress Revealed that the blog had been set up on January 23, only four days before the Altoid post. If this wasn't the first mention of Silk Road, it was certainly one of them. Altoid became a person of interest, but who was he? Further research revealed that Altoid had been posting on a board called Bitcoin Talk\u2014further suggesting a possible link to the Silk Road, which operated on Bitcoin. A key break came when the agent found an October 11, 2011 post by Altoid, looking for an \"IT pro in the Bitcoin community\" and directing all inquiries to \"rossulbricht at gmail dot com.\" A subpoena to Google revealed that this account was in fact registered to one \"Ross Ulbricht.\" The account was also linked to a Google+ profile, which had a picture of Ulbricht and a link to his favorite videos on YouTube . The videos provided a key clue; several of them were from the libertarian Mises Institute, whose views jibed with the leanings of the Dread Pirate Roberts. In addition, Roberts had repeatedly linked up Mises videos when posting in the Silk Road forum and had referenced \"Austrian school\" economists like Ludwig von Mises, for whom the Institute was named. The clue was suggestive but not conclusive. Still, the pieces were coming together. The economic simulator Enlarge / Ulbricht and his horseshoe mustache. With the name Ross Ulbricht, the feds went to other social networks. They found Ulbricht on LinkedIn, where he talked about his dissatisfaction with the physics work he had been doing as a graduate student at Penn State. \"Now, my goals have shifted,\" Ulbricht wrote. \"I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind... The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.\" Could the \"economic simulation\" be, in fact, Silk Road? One tantalizing hint comes from an anonymous article published in alternative newspaper The Austin Cut , located in Austin, Texas where Ulbricht grew up. The story was, in essence, a primer on how to build Silk Road and an explanation of what made the site so amazing\u2014and the answers were \"freedom\" and \"lack of force.\" \"Hackers, anarchists, and criminals have been dreaming about these days since forever,\" wrote the author. \"Where you can turn on your computer, browse the web anonymously, make an untraceable cash-like transaction, and have a product in your hands, regardless of what any government or authority decides... This is about real freedom. Freedom from violence, from arbitrary morals and law, from corrupt centralized authorities, and from centralization altogether. While Silk Road and Bitcoin may fade or be crushed by their enemies, we've seen what free, leaderless systems can do. You can only chop off so many heads.\" The article's author then relayed a telling anecdote from Silk Road, one in which people began arguing over a botched deal. They got angry; one threatened violence, but he was simply mocked by other users because he had no way to find his target. \"It showed how successful Silk Road really is,\" wrote the author. \"It makes drug buying and selling so smooth that it's easy to forget what kinds of violent fuckers drug dealers can be. That's the whole point of Silk Road. It totally takes evil pieces of shit out of the drug equation. Whether they're vicious drug dealers or bloodthirsty narcotics cops, both sides of that coin suck and end pretty much the same way. Death, despair, madness, prison, etc. Thanks to decentralization and powerful encryption, we're able to operate in a digital world that is almost free from prohibition and the violence it causes.\" This fits with Ulbricht's arguments, and the piece might well be by him, providing a better sense of why he saw the experiment as such an important one. We asked the editor of the Cut what he thought. \"I wondered the same thing,\" he said, but he added that he didn't know who wrote the piece. In any event, the feds had a name but no hard evidence linking Ulbricht to the site management. They knew that Ulbricht had moved to San Francisco and was staying for some time with a friend, and they knew that whoever was logging into the \"rossulbricht\" Gmail account was doing it on occasion from the friend's house. But the next link in the chain only came when the feds uncovered a post on the popular coding advice site StackOverflow. In early 2012, Ulbricht registered a StackOverflow account using his Gmail address; the username was \"Ross Ulbricht.\" On March 16, Ulbricht asked for help with connecting \"to a Tor hidden server using curl in php.\" He included several lines of code that weren't working quite right. Perhaps realizing that this was a bad idea, one minute later Ulbricht changed his username to \"frosty\" (he changed his e-mail address a bit later), but he had already revealed his interest in running Tor sites. At this point, the government gets cryptic. On July 10, 2013, Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package coming from Canada into the US as part of a \"routine border search.\" This package contained nine counterfeit IDs, each of them in a different name, but each of them showing a picture of Ulbricht. They were addressed to his San Francisco address. Two weeks later, the government found the Silk Road servers in various foreign countries, though it won't say how. (The FBI gives no indication that Tor was compromised in this case, though given that the agency has recently found ways to spy on Tor users, it's hard to absolutely rule out the possibility.)\u00a0It's possible that finding various aliases for Ulbricht enabled agents to track the money used to pay for the servers, but the events may have been unrelated. The main Silk Road Web server was found in \"a certain foreign country\" that has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US. Under the terms of that treaty, the government asked for an image of the server's hard drives, which was made on July 23 and then turned over to the FBI. ( Update : Computer security research Nicholas Weaver speculates that \"the FBI (with a warrant) hacked the site sufficient to discover the site's IP by generating a non-Tor phone-home and then contacted the country of the hosting provider which then got the server imaged. Yet since the server imaging didn't involve taking the server down or disrupting service sufficient to spook Mr DPR into taking his bitcoins and running, I suspect that this was some virtual-machine hosting provider.\" But at this point, no one knows.) Three days later, agents from Homeland Security Investigations visited Ulbricht's 15th Street home in San Francisco. They found him at home, where his two housemates knew him as \"Josh.\" One of them told the agents that \"Josh\" was \"always home in his room on the computer.\" As for Ulbricht himself, he refused to answer most questions, though he did volunteer one curious bit of information, apparently as a way of indicating that such documents could be obtained so easily that anyone might have ordered them, or that he had been framed. \"Hypothetically,\" he told the agents, anyone could visit a site named \"Silk Road\" on \"Tor\" and order any drugs or fake IDs they wanted.", "lede": "If you've been living under a cultural rock the Dread Pirate Robe...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Twitter Reveals $1 Billion IPO Plan", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 09:31:46", "content": "Twitter Inc. on Thursday revealed plans to raise up to $1 billion in a public offering, looking to cash in on a messaging service that has transformed public conversation but is still losing money and facing challenges attracting new users and advertisers. Twitter's Annotated S-1 Read the full document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with key sections highlighted. Twitter released the filing for its initial public offering on Thursday. The social media company did not specify the amount of shares or price range, but set a maximum amount for the deal at $1 billion. MarketWatch's Dan Gallagher reports. (Photo: Getty Images) Potential buyers for the first time saw the financials behind one of the most anticipated stock-market debuts of the year, which showed the social network's revenue more than doubled to $254 million in the first six months of this year. But its net loss grew by 40% to $69 million as the company's expenses ballooned. Twitter's user growth is also slowing, and prices for advertisements, which make up the bulk of the company's revenue, are falling. \"They certainly have a lot of work ahead of them to get mainstream America to understand\" how Twitter works, said Brian Solis, an analyst at the Altimeter Group. Twitter had previously shielded the figures by filing its initial IPO documents confidentially in July, under a new federal law. The amount raised in the filing is an estimate that could change when Twitter launches its investor \"roadshow,\" where it will formally pitch its stock to investors. The document suggests Twitter recently valued itself at about $9.7 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding, or at about $13 billion when including equity awards. Twitter chose TWTR as its ticker symbol but hasn't specified whether it will trade on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market .

Bios: Who's Who at Twitter Read about the leaders and founders of Twitter. In seven years, Twitter has grown from a wobbly startup to a social phenomenon where in just 140 characters its 215 million monthly active users tap out more than 500 million messages each day. The short-message service serves as a global forum in which users break news, organize protests and gripe about what they ate for lunch. As early as 2008, Twitter turned eyewitnesses into \"citizen journalists\" who reported on a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Now, once-elusive public figures including the pope, Warren Buffett and Kanye West \"tweet\" their thoughts and interact with other users. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo uses the service to answer users' troubleshooting queries. Businesses, stock pickers and politicians alike analyze the sentiments expressed on Twitter as important indicators. Despite its ubiquity, Twitter remains an immature business. The filing showed Twitter has far fewer users and generates less revenue per user than Facebook . When Facebook filed for a public offering, the company revealed sales of $3.7 billion and a profit of $1 billion for 2011. It also had 845 million monthly active users, a huge bragging point as it pitched itself to investors. Twitter's growth is also a question. The majority of Twitter's revenue, about 75%, is from the U.S., even though three-quarters of monthly users are outside the U.S. Facebook also has a wide gap between its usage and its ad revenue outside the U.S., where advertising businesses typically are less mature. In the second quarter, Twitter's growth in monthly active users slowed to 7% from three months earlier, compared with 10% to 11% growth in the prior three quarters. Like Facebook, Twitter makes money mostly by selling advertising based on users' posts. As they compete for advertisers, both companies position themselves as the world's online town square. Twitter also has as a second business licensing its data companies that analyze user tweets for insights on news events and social trends. That business generated $47.5 million in revenue last year, roughly 15% of the total. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is spearheading Twitter's IPO, but its rival Morgan Stanley won a measure of vindication by landing the second-biggest role in the deal. Morgan Stanley had led Facebook's IPO, and was criticized after Facebook shares fell as much as 50% in their first three months of trading, though the stock has since recovered and is well above its initial price. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. also is in the lead group of banks, meaning that the same three banks that led Facebook's IPO will lead Twitter's. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank AG are also serving as underwriters. The largest Twitter shareholder specified in the filing is co-founder Evan Williams , who owns 12% before the offering. He became Twitter's CEO in 2008 before being replaced by Mr. Costolo in 2010. At Twitter's most-recent internal valuation, Mr. Williams' stake would be valued at nearly $1.2 billion. Other major shareholders listed in the filing include venture-capital firm Benchmark Capital, which owns 6.7% and invested in Twitter early on; co-founder Jack Dorsey, with 4.9%; and Mr. Costolo, who holds 1.6%. Based on the internal valuation, Benchmark's stake would be valued at about $651 million; Mr. Dorsey's stake would be worth roughly $483 million; and Mr. Costolo's shares would be valued at about $155 million. Four other venture-capital firms, Rizvi Traverse, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and DST Global, are listed as owning at least 5% of the shares, but specific share counts aren't listed. The clock is now ticking on when Twitter can begin its roadshow. The IPO filing must be public for at least 21 days before the company can set a price range and say how many shares it is selling. Companies typically take at least a week to travel to different cities and meet investors on the roadshow. That means if the process moves at full speed, Twitter could begin trading around the end of the month or the first week of November. As for the federal government shutdown, a person familiar with the deal said there isn't a big worry right now. But a shutdown extending three weeks or longer could possibly slow the offering if the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't operating at all when Twitter begins the roadshow, this person said. The deal will be watched by other technology companies looking to go public, such as Box Inc., an online storage company, and Square Inc., the mobile-payments company created by Mr. Dorsey. Several of those companies delayed potential public offerings after shares of Internet companies such as Facebook, Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. sagged after their debuts. But shares in Internet companies have surged this year, amid a broader rally in the U.S. stock market. \u2014Rolfe Winkler and Elizabeth Dwoskin contributed to this article.

A partnership including Jared Kushner , a 32-year-old real estate developer and technology investor, closed on Wednesday on five of six properties in a $375 million deal and he said they plan to convert them into a hub for technology companies. The Watchtower properties are being sold by the Jehovah's Witnesses, one of the largest properties the church has sold as it relocates its headquarters upstate. An agreement to sell the sixth building would close in 2017. The 1.2 million-square-foot complex will be at least 50% offices, said a person familiar with the matter, with bigger and pricier spaces aimed at more mature companies than most in the neighborhood. The partners would undertake a roughly $100 million renovation of the buildings, accommodating up to 5,000 bikes, creating outdoor roof space, allowing for 150,000 square feet of retail space occupied almost entirely by Brooklyn companies and installing state-of-the-art Internet connectivity. Mr. Kushner, chief executive of Kushner Companies, said the developers would work with the city to try to convert some area streets into pedestrian plazas. \"We saw these buildings as an opportunity to really create a great campuslike environment,\" Mr. Kushner said. To many neighborhood observers, the plans for the complex would solidify the transformation of Dumbo\u2014one of Brooklyn's main office districts\u2014from its status in the early 2000s as an offbeat neighborhood for startups into a high-profile office destination that competes with neighborhoods like Flatiron and Chelsea. \"Dumbo will become more official, more formal and more professionalized by these tenants,\" said Chris Havens, a commercial broker who worked for five years at Two Trees Management Co., the largest property owner in the area. \"It's turned from a village into a town.\" Rents at the tech campus would be in the mid-$50s per square foot, according to people familiar with the matter. That would make them about double the rents in the rest of Dumbo, and about $10 below rents for hip Manhattan spaces. Bloomberg News Jared Kushner, above in February, sees 'an opportunity to really create a great campus-like environment' in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood. Mr. Kushner said he and his partners, RFR Realty and LIVWRK Holdings, a real-estate startup by Asher Abehsera, a former Two Trees' executive, weighed whether the complex should include more housing or office space. \"We would make more money if we did the whole thing as residential, but we would have less fun,\" Mr. Kushner said. The decision to focus more on office space is likely an easier sell to the community. Mr. Kushner and his partners would need to rezone parts of the property they would convert to residential use, which requires approval from the local City Council member, Stephen Levin. Mr. Levin said he hasn't been briefed on the details of the plans but said Mr. Kushner seemed savvy about the need for more office space in the area. The area under the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge overpasses was once one of Brooklyn's main manufacturing hubs, home to firms like Arbuckle Brothers and makers of the Brillo pad. The cobble-stoned neighborhood went into steep decline in the late 20th Century as companies moved their operations out of the city, but it began experiencing a residential revival in the 1970s when artists started moving in. By the 1980s, a few companies began moving in, and today the area has some 1.8 million square feet of office space. \"Dumbo has not been this tight since 1945, since World War II,\" Mr. Havens said. The history of the Jehovah's Witnesses site mirrors Brooklyn's industrial decline. The printing facility, operated through much of the 20th century, was once the largest in the city, producing hundreds of millions of Bibles, books, magazines and pamphlets, according to Richard Devine, a church spokesman. The organization closed its printing operations in the city in 2004 as large-scale modern equipment demanded more sprawling facilities. The organization's plans for a new campus upstate became known in 2009. Since then developers and community leaders have speculated about the future of the printing site, the most prominent development opportunity in an area dominated by landmarked funky warehouse buildings. The city also recently announced a deal with a developer to convert the Empire Stores, vacant warehouse buildings in Dumbo, to retail and about 300,000 square feet of office space. Two Trees executives said they aren't concerned about competition with a huge block of new office space because rents for newer spaces are significantly higher and their buildings tend to appeal to smaller companies. \"We're at zero vacancy. If Dumbo continues to become a home for these types of company, I think supply contributes to that perception,\" said David Lombino, director of special projects at Two Trees. \"A rising tide lifts all boats.\" Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com A version of this article appeared October 4, 2013, on page A25 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Deal Will Transform Dumbo.", "lede": "For four years, a cluster of properties near the foot of the Manh...", "link": "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304906704579113823704492920.html"}, {"author": "None", "title": "Samsung Predicts Record Profit", "feed_title": "WSJ.com: What's News Technology", "updated_at": "2013-10-04 11:05:44", "content": "Article Excerpt BY MIN-JEONG LEE AND JONATHAN CHENG SEOUL\u2014Samsung Electronics Co. issued guidance for record operating profit in the third quarter, but the company could face pressure from shareholders to unleash its cash pile as saturation in the smartphone market threatens a slowdown in earnings growth for the South Korean company.

(After all, consumers don't camp out for days to buy new cars or clothes.) So it isn't surprising that one fan set out to erect a photographic shrine to every single Apple product ever created, from the Apple I computer in 1976 to the iPad mini. Apple Products Through the Years Jonathan Zufi See a selection of photos from a new coffee-table book about Apple products. Photos and captions by Jonathan Zufi. Four years ago, Jonathan Zufi, a 42-year-old Australian native, began buying up more than 500 products: desktops, Apple's first commercial printer and iPods\u2014some in vintage packaging. He rented a storage unit to hold all the goods. He built a studio in the basement of his Atlanta home to photograph them, placing each item carefully against the same type of futuristic white backdrop used on apple.com and in Apple stores. He got a photography professor to help him learn to take professional shots. \"I wanted to create a repository where people who also love the company and its products could go and reminisce,\" says Mr. Zufi, a mobility expert at SAP America Inc. who says he has never worked for Apple Inc. The idea, he says, was to trace the company's evolution both in electronics and design from a user's point of view. \"I want people who are a bit younger who think Apple just makes things that start with \"i\" to know this company used to make clunky printers.\" The result is a collection of more than 150,000 photos, some 3,500 of which Mr. Zufi displays on a website (www.shrineofapple.com) and more than 650 of which he has curated into a new 326-page coffee-table-sized book. \"Iconic: A Photographic Tribute to Apple Innovation,\" is self-published and available at www.iconicbook.com. A new self-published book, \"Iconic,\" offers catnip to Apple zealots. Photographer and Apple enthusiast Jonathan Zufi assembled a photographic tribute to every product Apple ever made. Photo: Jonathan Zufi A paean to the evolution of the personal computer and a company that changed consumer behavior, it looks like the kind of book Apple itself might market\u2014except that the company has long been adamant about focusing on the future rather than celebrating its past. Apple even donated its old hardware, papers, and other historical materials to Stanford University in 1997. Representatives from Apple didn't respond to requests for comment about the project. Unlike many other books about Apple, Mr. Zufi's consists of photos and little text. There is a circuit board from the original Apple computer, the Apple I, which \"now seems as primitive as the Model T,\" writes Daniel Kottke, one of the company's original employees, in an introduction to a chapter on desktops. There's the Apple II, circa 1977, one of the first successful home computers, and a Macintosh prototype in a transparent case\u2014which Mr. Zufi says illustrates co-founder Steve Jobs ' obsession with making computer electronics fit a particular design. There's a \"Flower Power\" iMac G3, known for its brightly-colored plastic bubble-shaped design, and an Apple Lisa 2, which was a commercial failure. There are digital cameras and joysticks. There's also an entire chapter on packaging\u2014another Apple design obsession. Along the way, Mr. Zufi met with collectors around the country, loading dusty collections of valuable prototypes into rental cars and photographing them, sometimes in makeshift studios in hotel rooms. He convinced Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak to contribute a foreword to the book. In an email, Mr. Wozniak said Mr. Zufi included equipment that few would even know about, including Mr. Wozniak himself. The work \"blows me away,\" he said. Mr. Zufi says his original goal of shooting every Apple product will be impossible to meet. \"I am still finding out about products they dabbled with, released in limited numbers in specific markets, and so on,\" he says. While he has emptied the storage unit and sold most of the items he bought, about 15 remain, including an enormous monitor in his garage, he says.

News Corp 's HarperCollins Publishers has agreed to make available the majority of its U.S. backlist titles to a books subscription service operated by Scribd Inc., a Web-based service. The move increases the number of titles available on Scribd's subscription service to more than 50,000 available from traditional publishers, Scribd said. But HarperCollins isn't making its new titles available, which could limit the service's appeal. Neither side would disclose the precise number of older books coming from HarperCollins. Scribd is one of a number of online book-subscription programs emerging, as technology executives explore whether the success of subscription offerings in music and television can be emulated with books. \"We want to be the Netflix of books,\" said Trip Adler, chief executive of Scribd, a San Francisco-based company that is closely held by its founders and a small group of equity investors. Scribd offers unlimited access to its titles for $8.99 a month. The company, whose online platform hosts e-books and documents from numerous sources, also will sell new and backlist titles from all HarperCollins's U.S. imprints. Other publishers providing books to the Scribd subscription service include Kensington Publishing Corp., which is providing new and old titles. \"We're interested in exploring the subscription model and seeing how it performs,\" said Steve Zacharius, Kensington's chief executive. Among other new subscription services is a company called Oyster, which launched in September. Oyster subscribers paying $9.95 a month have unlimited access to more than 100,000 titles. North Carolina-based eReatah Inc. is expected to launch later this month with 90,000 new and old titles from traditional publishers. Unlike Scribd and Oyster, eReatah will offer a tiered pricing approach. HarperCollins has struck deals to supply a limited number of titles to both eReatah and Oyster. CBS Corp.'s Simon &amp; Schuster has also struck a deal to supply books to eReatah. But most other major publishers have been wary about striking deals with subscription services, worried about cannibalizing book sales. Book executives also question whether consumers will embrace such subscription services, particularly as the new services have limited books available, particularly among new releases. \"If somebody wants the new Stephen King or John Grisham, and they can't get it, they'll go somewhere else,\" said Carol Fitzgerald, president of the Book Report Inc., a closely held company that operates a network of websites connecting books and readers. \"Also, can't people do this through their local library and get whatever they want?\" HarperCollins isn't providing new titles to Scribd subscription users. \"I don't know if it makes sense strategically to include new books,\" said Brian Murray, chief executive of HarperCollins, noting the potential for conflict with book retailers. HarperCollins is a unit of News Corp, which also owns The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Murray added that he considered the agreement with Scribd to be significant because of its \"huge installed base of active users and its global reach.\" Scribd claims 80 million active users and is available in 100 countries.

STEWART and SUZANNE VRANICA The website Songsrpeople.com looks a lot like other amateur-video sites. It is wallpapered with clips featuring \"the most insane amusement park ever\" and \"your girlfriend's six friends.\" The site draws tens of thousands of visitors a month, according to audience measurement firms. It also has ads for national brands, including Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and State Farm. But Web-security investigators at a firm called White Ops contend that most of the site's visitors aren't people. Rather, they are computer-generated visitors, or \"bots,\" designed to fool advertisers into paying for the traffic, says White Ops, which has blacklisted the site\u2014and thousands more like it\u2014so that ads from clients such as Zipcar don't land there. An anonymous representative for Songsrpeople declined to discuss the site's traffic but in an email called the White Ops methodology into question. State Farm said it was looking into the matter while Target declined to comment and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Authorities and Internet-security experts say tens of thousands of dubious websites are popping up across the Internet. Their phony Web traffic is often fueled by \"botnets,\" zombie armies of hijacked PCs that are controlled from unknown locations around the world, according to Internet security experts. The sites take advantage of the simple truth that advertisers pay to be seen. This creates an incentive for fraudsters to erect sites with phony traffic, collecting payments\u2014often through middlemen and sometimes directly from advertisers. \"When you walk into this world, you walk with eyes wide open,\" said Brian Harrington, chief marketing officer at Zipcar, which ran a recent ad campaign, assisted by White Ops to filter out bogus traffic. \"You know stuff is not real.\" At their most sophisticated, botnets can mimic the behavior of online consumers, clicking from one site to the next, pausing at ads, watching videos, and even putting items in shopping carts. Earlier in the year, an FBI operation, \"Ghost Click,\" resulted in two men from Estonia pleading guilty in U.S. federal court in New York for their roles in a botnet ad-fraud scheme. The fraud involved four million hijacked computers in 100 different countries and yielded at least $14 million for a group of seven, federal prosecutors said. \"It's drug-level money, but you don't have to kill anyone,\" says Tamer Hassan, a co-founder and chief technology officer of White Ops, a year-old startup in New York that has developed technology that it says can spot robotic traffic and uncover digital ad fraud. Security experts say that botnets can be rented or purchased on private forums and message boards around the world. In a translation of one proposal written in Russian, a member called \"Shantaram\" offers to drive 1,000 visitors to any website for $1, noting that it can source the traffic to any country \"desired.\" Hackers build botnets by infecting computers with malware, which are regularly buried in email attachments or disguised as legitimate website downloads. Those infected computers are then connected by a command machine, which stealthily directs the network of zombies to do its work, whatever it may be. A computer user may not be aware of it. Ad industry executives blame the murky and complicated online ad ecosystem for creating an environment for the fraud. Most publishers, big and small, sell inventory through multiple channels, using middlemen who aggregate space across a host of sites and resell it to brands. The middlemen include ad networks, which often have sales teams, as well as ad exchanges, which employ automated systems that allow advertisers to bid on publishers' inventory. That inventory can be supplied either directly by the publisher, by ad networks, or through other companies that help websites sell their ad space. It isn't unusual for marketers to now have ads running across hundreds of different websites, elevating the chances that ads could land on questionable sites, unbeknownst to the advertiser. Even when advertisers find out their ads ran on a botnet-fueled site, there's no formal process for them to get their money back, ad buyers say. Automated systems have \"enabled greater buying efficiencies and controls, but also made it easier for the bad guys,\" said Arthur Muldoon, co-founder and chief executive of the media buying firm Accordant Media, whose clients include Starwood Hotels, Seamless and Zipcar. To sift out bad traffic, Accordant uses a growing cast of security and verification companies, including comScore Inc., DoubleVerify and White Ops. Last year it doubled the money it spent on their services. Accordant also has a swelling blacklist of sites where it won't buy ads. That list has tripled from last year and now includes hundreds of thousands of sites. White Ops was founded by Mr. Hassan, Michael J.J. Tiffany, Ash Kalb and well-known Internet security researcher Dan Kaminsky about a year ago and operates out of a science-fiction bookstore in Brooklyn. Early on, the company chased bank fraud schemes. But that changed when someone at a party showed Mr. Tiffany a snapshot on his iPhone: a $900,000 check from an ad network. The acquaintance said he had gamed the ad network into thinking he hosted sites with big traffic. \"It got me thinking, 'We should take a look at this,'\" said Mr. Tiffany, the chief executive of the company. White Ops has cataloged tens of thousands of suspect websites. Its technology identifies bots in real time and then prevents ads from going to the bad sites. The aim is to strike at the cash flow of the scam sites instead of trying to put \"guys in handcuffs,\" Mr. Tiffany says. Digital ad spending in the U.S. is expected to jump 14.9% this year to $42.3 billion, according to eMarketer. Most websites make money from advertisers based on how many people visit the sites. While low traffic sites can earn 25 cents per thousand views, more well-known sites can make as much as $20 for every thousands views. Video ads tend to fetch higher ad rates. Some experts say ad networks and exchanges aren't screening the publishers they work with well enough, and therefore are partly responsible for botnet-related fraud. Critics say the middlemen have a conflict of interest, since they get a cut of fees advertisers pay. \"If they reduce the fraud, they reduce their revenue,\" said Jeremiah Grossman, founder and chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security, a Web-application security firm in Santa Clara, Calif. \"Follow the money\u2014the blame [for the fraud] lies with the entity that gains the most,\" said Susan Bidel, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \"That would be the publishers and every middleman that gets a fee to process [the ad buy]. They are all complicit in some way, whether they are actively complicit or passively.\" The middlemen say they are doing their best to stamp out fraud using their own filter techniques and policing teams to weed out fraudulent publishers. They reject the notion that they are turning a blind eye to botnets. \"Everybody recognizes that this is a problem,\" said Steve Sullivan, vice president of advertising technology at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a digital ad industry trade group. \"The reality is some of those companies are in fact doing the best they can.\" While some scammers create stand-alone operations, others devise sprawling empires. In one case, the White Ops technology uncovered a zombie-populated lifestyle network, with hundreds of connected sites, including bodybuildingfaq.com, financestalk.com, and abctraveling.com. No one at the sites could be reached for comment. In some scenarios, legitimate websites inadvertently set themselves up for botnet invasions when they hire companies to help boost their traffic. That can involve building audiences through methods such as paid keyword-search advertising with search engines. White Ops discovered that more than 30% of the visitors to the education portal Education.com were robots. In the past month the site received about four million unique views, according to Quantcast. A spokesman for Education.com said it was aware of the bot-traffic and that it had likely come from an initiative in the summer to boost its audience numbers. Education.com had bought traffic from a variety of legitimate sources, including search engines, to lure in new subscribers, as well as users \"who would perform well for advertisers.\" \"We shut down the program,\" the spokesman said. Online measurement company comScore said well-known websites with heavy traffic can have single digit percentages of bad traffic while lesser-known sites might get 25% of their traffic from bots. The losses to ad fraud are hard to nail down. Security company Solve Media Inc., for instance, estimates that up to 29% of display advertising traffic world-wide is driven by bot armies, and could cost advertisers roughly $10 billion dollars this year, the company said. Microsoft Corp. and security-software maker Symantec Corp. recently went after a network called Bamital, which the companies estimated had been taking in more than $1 million a year from ad fraud. A federal court order shut down Bamital and U.S. Marshals confiscated the servers behind the cyber operation. The companies are now doing forensics on the equipment, hoping to uncover in part the workings of a botnet business, as well as the location of the people behind it.

This dramatic principle is called Chekhov\u2019s gun, and it actually applies quite well to the natural world: Animals don\u2019t waste energy developing worthless characteristics. Traits that help a species survive get passed along through generations, while those that are no longer useful fade away (or in the stubbornly contrary case of the human appendix, abruptly explode). If Chekhov had time-traveled back between 8 million and 20 million years and met Platybelodon \u2014 an ancestor of the modern elephant that looked like it got hit in the face with a shovel, then absorbed that shovel into its mouth \u2014 he would have demanded the creature explain itself. What possible purpose could such a ridiculous trait serve? \u201cA good one, thank you very much,\u201d Platybelodon would reply, probably in a really funny voice. The spork-faced Platybelodon\u2019 s strange jutting jaw actually consists of a second pair of flattened, widened tusks (tusks themselves being modified incisors). When the genus Platybelodon , which means \u201cflat tooth,\u201d and its species were first described in the 1920s, \u201ctheir lower incisors were thought to function to shovel, scoop, dig and dredge soft vegetation in aquatic or swampy environments,\u201d vertebrate paleontologist William Sanders of the University of Michigan wrote in an email to WIRED. \u201cBut recent analysis of tusk wear surfaces show that they were used more as scythes to cut tough vegetation.\u201d The paleontologist who proposed this slicing behavior in 1992, David Lambert, theorized that instead of roaming shorelines, Platybelodon fed on terrestrial plants, grasping branches with its trunk and cutting them away with its built-in scythe. Indeed, cross-sections of the tusks reveal a structure that provides extra strength and resistance to abrasion for such foraging, said Sanders. So it could well be that Platybelodon wandered around Miocene Asia, Africa, and North America, scything vegetation like some sort of peasant, only without all the pesky class struggles. And it was just one of a horde of similar animals in the family Gomphotheriidae , all with modified lower tusks of varying styles. The Platybelodon genus alone had more than 15 species, reaching \u201cthe apex of development of these lower tusks,\u201d according to Sanders. Their radically flattened teeth suggest \u201cstrong selection for specialized feeding on a particular range of plants,\u201d which was crucial given that \u201cfor much of the Miocene there were often three to five or more genera of proboscideans occurring in the same landscape, competing for forage.\u201d Pegging the various appearances of such proboscideans, though, is difficult, because flesh-like schnozes don\u2019t fossilize as easily as bone. We\u2019re actually quite lucky to have Platybelodon preserved at all, considering that fossilization is a really hard thing to pull off . Even if you can avoid getting carted off in a dozen different directions by scavengers, you need to settle in the right spot. And Platybelodon just so happened to do us a solid by dying \u2014 sometimes en masse \u2014 next to or in rivers, the prime locales for fossilization. Henry Fairfield Osborn, a paleontologist who described Platybelodon in a 1932 paper and quite extensively four years later in his book Proboscidea , accordingly assumed the creature to be a water-dredger (thanks to the work of Lambert and others we now believe that Platybelodon , like a lot of animals, was probably just partial to water and happened to sometimes die in it). In his book, Osborn quoted another paleontologist, Alexei Borissiak, who in 1929 wrote that Platybelodon was \u201cdeprived of a trunk\u201d but would scoop through the water and \u201cseize its food with its muscular upper lip, covering the mandible.\u201d In fact, Borissiak reckoned Platybelodon\u2019 s snout looked a bit like that of the hippopotamus, \u201calthough much more lengthened out.\u201d Osborn\u2019s illustrations of Platybelodon certainly reflect this. But \u201cthink about what an elephant looks like,\u201d Sanders asks us. \u201cThe trunk is a very separate entity from the mouth. You have to be able to get food into your mouth, and if your front limbs are occupied in posture, and you have upper and lower tusks that would make it difficult to have a long projecting tongue or mobile lips, then you need a proboscis.\u201d \u201c[Osborn's] ego preceded his expertise,\u201d he added, \u201cand we are still digging out from the weight of his \u2018authority\u2019 on proboscideans.\u201d Yet Osborn\u2019s flat trunk/lip persists in most modern reconstructions \u2014 including an oh-so-close-to-actually-being-cute one in the Ice Age movies \u2014 conflicting with Lambert\u2019s more widely accepted grab-and-scythe theory. Trunks aside, could the bizarre mug of Platybelodon , so wonderfully adapted for feeding, have proved cumbersome when, say, fleeing from predators? Sanders doesn\u2019t think so. And even if Platybelodon did face-plant here and there, its size would have proved quite the advantage as far as not getting eaten goes. It was somewhat smaller than the modern African elephant, which only rarely falls prey to that continent\u2019s apex predator, the lion. But according to Sanders, Platybelodon might have had a counterpart predator in the ferocious wolf-like creodonts , meaning \u201cflesh tooth,\u201d meaning a slicing tooth designed to deprive you of flesh, meaning let\u2019s be grateful it was Platybelodon worrying about them and not us. So be they teeth like scissors or teeth like a shovel, evolution never creates a rifle it doesn\u2019t intend to fire.

It was also popularized by photographer Vincent Laforet, who used a tilt-shift lens to make the real world look like a miniature model of itself (check the photos here and here ). It was a different way of seeing things that was surprising and fun to look at. The problem is, most of us aren\u2019t as good as Laforet, so we have to proceed with caution if we\u2019re going to make effective selective-focus pictures. Too often we get sidetracked by the technique and forget to make a picture that can stand on its own. Boring food photo? Shoot it with a selective focus lens or apply the feature in Instagram, and voil\u00e0! \u2014 a slightly less boring food photo. This misuse, or overuse, puts Lensbaby and its Pro Effects Kit (made for Canon and Nikon DSLRs) in a tough position. The kit offers two selective-focus optics, two macro converters, and a carrying case. It all costs $730, which is a good chunk of change to spend on something that should probably be used sparingly. Another knock against the kit is that it\u2019s not the easiest thing to use. To attach Lensbaby optics to your DSLR you first have to snap something called the Composer Pro onto your camera\u2019s lens mount. The Composer Pro comes with the kit and is the piece that, using a ball and joint system, lets you swivel the optics around and choose where you want your spot of focus, or \u201csweet spot,\u201d to land. Then you choose which optic \u2014 the \u201cSweet 35\u2033 (35mm focal length) or the \u201cEdge 80\u2033 (80mm focal length) \u2014 to insert into the composer. Being able to choose different optics is a nice feature, but inserting and removing the optics is a total pain. The first time I mounted the Sweet 35 I thought it was secure but it fell out as soon as I picked up the camera. To remove an optic you have to master a push and spin technique that is not easy. I thought I broke the optics several times because I had to push so hard. It takes a minute to figure out how to control the swivel of the composer and place the sharp spot of your focus. But after a while it becomes fairly routine. In terms of ease of use, I prefer the Edge 80. At that focal length your sharp spot of focus is more defined and easier to place where you want it. Once I got the hang of everything, I admit I had fun testing the kit. It was a refreshing challenge to try and find \u201cappropriate\u201d uses for the optics, and I never had any complaints about the quality of the glass and the sharpness of my pictures. Both optics are reasonably fast \u2014 the aperture on the Edge 80 goes to 2.8 and the aperture on the Sweet 35 goes to 2.5 \u2014 so they performed well in low light on my Canon 5D Mark II. Since the test, however, the optics just sit in my bag. That\u2019s partly because I\u2019m in front a computer most of the time. But it\u2019s also because I find myself weary of pulling them out unless I\u2019ve planned a shoot that highlights their strengths. The entire Lensbaby Pro Effects Kit costs considerably less than one Nikon or Canon tilt shift lens ($1,300 \u2013 $2,500), which also creates a selective focus effect. But dollar for dollar I can think of several other $730 purchases I\u2019d rather have in my camera bag quiver. If you\u2019re set on using a selective focus lens on your DSLR, you can buy the Composer Pro with just the Sweet 35 for $380. The Edge 80 by itself sells for $300. If that\u2019s still too much, you might try the Lensbaby Spark. It\u2019s a low-end 50mm selective focus optic with a fixed aperture that you focus with rubberized bellows. It\u2019s not half as sharp as the Sweet 35 or the Edge 80, but at $90 it\u2019s a good way to get your feet wet. The photos you get with the Spark often resemble something you\u2019d get from a toy camera, but if used with a little ingenuity, it can be a lot of fun and you\u2019ll spend a lot less money trying to figure out if selective focus photography is indeed for you.

But Cady Coleman found a way to get Sandra Bullock\u2019s. All she had to do was go into space. Back in 2011 the NASA astronaut was on an expedition on the International Space Station while her brother Chris Coleman was on Earth \u2013 California, specifically \u2013 meeting a man whose sister-in-law happened to be Bullock. The two got to talking about what their family members did and decided they needed to connect Coleman and Bullock, who was about to star in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s lost-in-space flick Gravity . \u201cIt took a week or so to be able to talk [to her] just because we have an internet-protocol phone on the station that we can use to make calls, but I needed her cell phone number \u2013 you can\u2019t call us, we can call you,\u201d Coleman told WIRED, while not on a space station. \u201cShe\u2019s probably not so used to giving out that cell phone number so I had to write and say, \u2018You can give me your number, I won\u2019t give it away.\u2019\u201d Eventually Coleman, who has logged more than 4,330 hours in space for NASA on two space shuttle missions and that stint on the ISS, was able to chat with Bullock \u2014 from space \u2014 and give her advice on everything from how to move in zero gravity to how to deal with the psychological toll of being unable to go home (something Bullock\u2019s Ryan Stone struggles with heavily while trying to get back to Earth in Gravity ). She also began recording voice memos of things she thought might be helpful for the actress and sending her audio clips of helpful pointers. \u201cI\u2019d be going about my work and think, \u2018Oh Sandra would probably want to know about this,\u2019\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIt did kind of make me fly around the space station with new eyes, because I was trying to be Sandra\u2019s eyes.\u201d It worked. Bullock\u2019s performance in Gravity is shattering, and the film \u2014 in Coleman\u2019s eyes \u2014 is the most accurate portrayal of her actual experiences in space ever to make it to the big screen (minus the debris collisions). WIRED asked Coleman about her talks with Bullock, truth in Hollywood movies, and the importance of female astronauts in movies. WIRED: Visually, Gravity feels incredibly life-like. How close is it \u2013 visually \u2013 to what you\u2019ve experienced as an astronaut? Cady Coleman: Something that\u2019s frustrating to me in my job is that I think it\u2019s a very special job. It\u2019s been a great privilege to go to space and to see the things that I see. Really, just to be up there doing work that you just know is really important in such a special place, and yet you don\u2019t really get to bring anybody that you know and love with you. A movie like this is a way for me to bring people to space. I will bring my mother to this. I will make everybody in my family go see this. I don\u2019t know what other people who haven\u2019t seen space think, but I feel like you get to see the view. I met Cuar\u00f3n in the last couple weeks and he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been to space!\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t been to space \u2013 since you made that movie.\u201d WIRED: Was there anything that felt inauthentic? Coleman: I couldn\u2019t help but look at some things and go, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d do that.\u2019 But that\u2019s not the point of the movie. I don\u2019t know if when Apollo 13 came out everyone ran around going \u2018Is that real? Is that real?\u2019 because [it wasn't] quite as sensational \u2026 But people do ask [about how authentic Gravity is], and partly they\u2019re asking because, boy, if it\u2019s that real then why would anybody ever go? It\u2019s sensational. It\u2019s a lot of things that maybe could happen, but for them all to happen on the same day is more than coincidental. But they\u2019re all things that we consider at NASA. WIRED: Yeah, space debris is obviously out there and a concern for space travel. How likely is it that astronauts would get pummeled by it the way they are in this movie? Coleman: In Gravity there\u2019s the debris storm that we see in the trailers, and the astronauts are knocked free and they\u2019re spinning in space. Well, we think about that all the time when we\u2019re doing space walks because it\u2019s really the worst thing in the world that could happen. So, what do we do at NASA? We make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s a really real risk, but we do what we can to mitigate it. I think that\u2019s true of some of the other things you see in Gravity \u2013 what makes it scary in the movie is that it is real, but not real to that extent. WIRED: What was your brother doing when he met Bullock\u2019s brother-in-law? Coleman: My little brother is a wine guy in Sonoma. He\u2019s in the innovative wine-packaging business. Specialty-cask sampling is I think how I\u2019m supposed to say it. As his sister I\u2019m not allowed to say that he does really, really high-end wine in a bag, but that\u2019s what he does. He met Sandra Bullock\u2019s brother-in-law and they got together and figured out what their sisters and sister-in-laws did and got us together. Sandra and I did this interview together recently \u2013 it was specifically for NASA, to air on a NASA channel \u2013 and the interviewer said, \u2018How did you and Cady meet?\u2019 And she looks at me and she says, \u2018Wine.\u2019 I had to look at her and go, \u201cWe have to start again, because if we don\u2019t they can\u2019t use it. We can\u2019t use an interview that starts with \u2018wine.\u2019\u201d WIRED: So what kind of advice did you give Sandra Bullock when you called her from the ISS? Coleman: My recollection is that we mostly talked about two kinds of things. One was physically how do you move up there? What do you hold on to? Are you fluid, are you angular, are you sort of dragging yourself around? The other was what it felt like to live in a place so far away from everybody that you know on the ground. And how do you deal with that separation and the fact that you can\u2019t just go home when you want. WIRED: What is that strain like? Coleman: Even the training is hard on your family \u2013 on your family life. It\u2019s hard to be away from your kid. [Ed. Note: Coleman has a husband and 13-year-old son.] Yet I feel like I was selected for this job and trained and invested a lot, and I believe in what we do and that it\u2019s the right thing for me to be at work when I\u2019m at work and not at home. But I think there\u2019s an emotional price that you pay for that compartmentalization. WIRED: Did you enjoy the fact that that lead in this film was a female astronaut? Coleman: I did. I love it when the hero of a film is a woman. And it\u2019s a woman who uses her head and thinks out what she knows and when that doesn\u2019t work she thinks again and she\u2019s very persistent. These are a lot of qualities that I think are very important that are going to be portrayed to a bunch of 13-year-old girls and they\u2019re going to think they\u2019re normal. They\u2019re going to realize that it\u2019s normal to be the hero. That it could be them \u2013 the hero could be them. The number of people that ask me if I feel bad about leaving my kid at home is too many to count, right? Sometimes I resent that they don\u2019t ask the guys the same question, which is insulting to the guys who also miss their kids. The answer is, \u201cYes, I feel really bad, but it is also the right thing to do.\u201d WIRED: Did any of that thinking inform your conversations with Bullock? Coleman: There has to be a little part of her that is thinking when we first talked, \u201cOk, I\u2019m talking to a woman that\u2019s just like left her kid on the planet and went away and didn\u2019t think anything of it. What kind of woman can do that?\u201d I think we went from that to realizing that I\u2019m the same kind of woman that feels badly about that but it feels like the right thing to do. I think making that human part of living in space \u2026 It\u2019s about the whole person up there. The very humanness of being up there was very clear for me and I believe that\u2019s some of what she got from talking to me.

It\u2019s yet another step in the rocky evolution of the so-called sharing economy, where companies such as Airbnb attempt to facilitate a more fluid exchange of goods and services via the internet. Most of the clashes over what\u2019s also being called \u201ccollaborative consumption\u201d have taken place in the heavily regulated arenas of rooms and rides. Airbnb chalked up a victory in one of the most recent disputes. Instead of gloating, however, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky extended a self-interested olive branch. Following New Yorker Nigel Warren\u2019s successful appeal of his $2,400 fine for renting out a room through Airbnb, Chesky said the company wants to work with New York City to create a clear legal framework for people to rent out their rooms and homes. \u201cOur hosts are not hotels, but we believe that it makes sense for our community to pay occupancy tax, with limited exemptions for those who earn under certain thresholds,\u201d he wrote . \u201cWe would like to assist New York City in streamlining this process so that it is not onerous.\u201d Chesky\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \u201cour hosts are not hotels\u201d \u2014 is interesting because it frames the willingness to collect taxes as a concession. Sharing-economy businesses such as Airbnb tend to portray themselves as platforms for facilitating connections between private individuals. Airbnb isn\u2019t running a hotel chain, the logic goes: it\u2019s helping people extract value from an unused asset \u2014 in this case, an apartment that would otherwise sit empty while the tenant is away for the weekend. As such, Airbnb\u2019s willingness to allow the collection of the city\u2019s hotel occupancy tax is a way of making nice, versus an alternative approach such as, say, battling the city in court over the definition of \u201chotel.\u201d If such a tax plan goes into effect, the money involved would probably be rather large. Airbnb says 15,000 people rent out their spaces through the company \u2014 87 percent of them the homes in which they live, according to Chesky. In New York City, hotel rooms renting for $40 per night or more are taxed at a rate of $2 per day per room plus 5.875 percent of the rate. So, a one-bedroom apartment near Times Square listed for $139 with a minimum three-night stay would involve an occupancy tax of more than $36 total. While that kind of extra charge might seem to cramp the sharing economy\u2019s style, it\u2019s the kind of compromise that seems inevitable. In California last month, the state\u2019s public utilities commission passed the country\u2019s first uniform regulations for ride-sharing , creating a legal framework for companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar. In effect, the rules require ride-sharing companies to follow the same safety and insurance standards as traditional taxi companies \u2014 standards the ride-sharing companies say they already exceed. Without such legal sanctions, however, the only other place sharing-economy disputes are likely to end up is in court. When it comes to who gets to share what with whom and who gets paid, conflict is inevitable. The only question is whether those conflicts get resolved through legislation or litigation.", "lede": "Airbnb \u2014 the company that lets you pay to stay wherever a strange...", "link": "http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/airbnb-taxes/"}]}, {"cluster": 24, "articles": [{"author": "Mary Bates", "title": "Dolphin Hear, Dolphin Do: Imitation by Echolocation", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 15:26:00", "content": "Humans are born imitators. The ability to imitate others comes naturally to us and plays a major role in how we learn about the world. But imitation is not widespread in the animal kingdom. True imitation, which goes beyond merely mimicking another\u2019s behavior to include purposeful intention, is rare. Dolphins are one of the few animals that can truly imitate. In 2010, researchers at the Dolphin Research Center (DRC) in Grassy Key, Florida, showed dolphins can imitate behaviors without using their eyesight . Dolphins were trained on a \u201cdo-as-I-do\u201d game, in which a model (in this case another dolphin) performed a specific behavior and the target dolphin was asked to imitate it. A young male dolphin named Tanner was able to imitate the model dolphin\u2019s behaviors even when he was \u201cblindfolded\u201d \u2014 fitted with soft, latex eyecups that completely blocked his sight. Now, a follow-up study shows not only how Tanner accomplished this task using sound, but also that he used a deliberate, problem-solving approach to imitation. The research was published in the journal Animal Cognition . Kelly Jaakkola, lead author on the two papers and Director of Research at DRC, suspected Tanner was using sound to imitate, but there were two possibilities: \u201cHe could have recognized the characteristic sound the behavior makes, just like you or I might recognize the sound of hands clapping, or he could have used echolocation to \u201csee\u201d the behavior with sound,\u201d she says. In the follow-up study, Jaakkola and her team changed how the behaviors sounded by using a human model instead of a dolphin. Like the dolphin model, the human model performed a variety of motor behaviors including bobbing up and down, spinning in a circle, and swimming like a fish with legs and feet moving side-to-side. A person moving in the water sounds very different from a dolphin moving in the water. With the sound changed, would Tanner still be able to recognize the behavior to copy it? Jaakkola and her colleagues showed Tanner had no problem imitating the human model using sound alone. But even more interesting was how he used sound. Tanner switched strategies when imitating a dolphin and a human. Specifically, when he imitated a human blindfolded, he produced many more echolocation clicks than when he had imitated a dolphin blindfolded. \u201cWhen he had been imitating the familiar-sounding dolphin behavior, he just recognized the characteristic sound of the behavior,\u201d Jaakkola says. \u201cBut when we gave him the less familiar sound of a human doing the behavior, he switched to using echolocation.\u201d This is the first demonstration of flexibility in using a new perceptual route to imitation in any non-human animal. Not only did Tanner use a new perceptual route, he switched strategies depending on the situation. He was flexible enough to seek new information, change strategies, and change his approach to the task. Jaakkola says this shows he wasn\u2019t just copying \u201cmindlessly,\u201d but was instead engaged in imitation as an intentional, problem-solving process. These experiments demonstrate dolphins can recognize and imitate trained behaviors, but Jaakkola is also interested in investigating spontaneous imitation in problem-solving situations. So far, all dolphin imitation studies have used the \u201cdo-as-I-do\u201d procedure where the dolphin is specifically asked to imitate a learned behavior. But in the real world, much of the value of imitation comes from observing how others solve problems and then spontaneously adopting their technique. The DRC team hopes to probe dolphins\u2019 abilities to imitate novel behaviors and look into whether dolphins spontaneously use imitation to learn from each other in more natural situations. Such experiments would not only shed light on the dolphin mind, but the evolution of imitation, as well. Since true imitation is so rare in the animal kingdom, it is likely that the ability evolved separately in humans and dolphins. Learning how dolphins use their imitation skills could provide insight into why they, and humans, became imitating animals at all. \u00a0 References: Jaakkola, K., Guarino, E., and Rodriguez, M.

These latter folks are the same ones who irrationally lust over crazy-expensive stereo gear. Especially gear from one of the few premium hi-fi brands of the 20th century still left on the planet: McIntosh. Back in the day, you had to have a McIntosh rig if you were serious about music (Just ask your dad). Well, the brand with the famous blue and green blinkenlights is still very much alive, and it has birthed a new turntable. The McIntosh MT5 turntable caresses every single groove of your precious vinyl. And for the asking price of $6,500, you should expect your records to receive some extra pampering. Using some finely tuned noise-suppression technology, the MT-5 will let you hear all the nuances of your favorite records without introducing any extra rumbles or vibrations into the audio signal. The silicon acrylic platter is both massive and stable, weighing five pounds and measuring one and one-half inches thick. It\u2019s suspended magnetically and driven by a high-end Swiss-made motor that uses two opposing neodymium magnets. By floating the platter with magnetic force instead of using ball bearings at the base, low-end rumble is all but eliminated. It\u2019s also one less part to wear down. Even cooler is the detail that everyone can appreciate: The platter glows the same McIntosh-flavored bright blue-green as the front glass panel. The custom tone arm is also stabilized by magnets. The anti-skating feature (something common to all turntables) applies a counter-force to suppress the arm\u2019s natural desire to swing toward the middle of the album. But since the McIntosh\u2019s tonearm does it by way of magnets, it further reduces any motor noises or additional sounds that could creep into the audio signal and alter the sounds being pulled from the record. What you end up with is a turntable that spins silently and sounds incredible. But all the craftsmanship required to deliver a pure audio signal will cost you a heap \u2014 probably more than you laid out for your first car. At $6,500, the MT5 isn\u2019t the turntable you\u2019d want to hook up to your $250 soundbar. But if you\u2019re really serious about sound, and maybe you\u2019ve recently won the lottery, this is one of the best ways to listen to vinyl. For a test run, I\u2019d recommend Meddle by Pink Floyd ( Dark Side is for squares).

When the stock market sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring on the day of the IPO, one thing was clear to me about Tesla: branding was everything . Now that Tesla has started making its second car at scale, it has delivered a quarter profit for the first time , and its shares have traded at a high of almost $195 per share, branding is still everything for Tesla. That\u2019s why the viral video of one of Tesla\u2019s Model S cars burning could be an actual problem for Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Model S has been rated as the safest car out there by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model S that\u2019s shown in the video in flames hit some metal debris on a freeway and Tesla says the fire started in one of the modules in the battery pack. The pack fire, as it turns out , was also difficult to put out. But whether or not an internal combustion car would have had a reaction on par to the Model S when it directly hit some metal debris (or ignited the fuel tank in some way), isn\u2019t really the question. The issue is how much damage can a viral video of a Model S on fire do to Tesla\u2019s valuable brand.

An investigation in a couple of fires during safety testing with Chevy\u2019s Volt back in 2011 , seem to contribute to a considerable freeze in Volt sales for awhile. Fires certainly weren\u2019t great publicity for Fisker\u2019s electric cars back when those were on sale. Large companies with diverse product lines can weather branding and publicity issues more easily than startups that have one product on the market. If that one product turns sour, there\u2019s nothing else out there to prop up the brand. But this fire issue could end up being another hurdle Tesla jumps over. Cars get in accidents, and bad things happen in accidents. But the company will likely have to work on its own PR campaign to be transparent but also soothe any worried customers.

The meat-and-potatoes battling you do as a Caos isn't far off from other 3D Diablo -likes of the past few years. You pick from swords, hammers, spears, and so on, then you battle waves of enemies by alternating between quick and strong weapon strikes and occasional blasts of magic. Defend by holding a block button, or dodge using a slightly awkward dash maneuver. As far as the genre competition is concerned, Ascend doesn't reach the swift polish of last year's Kingdoms of Amalur , but it feels solid and responsive enough to outpace something like Too Human, \u00a0not too bad for a free-to-play entry. The game tries to set itself apart with an overarching and ongoing three-faction war, based on which god each player picks. The basic Ascend experience is a solo affair, but other players' outlines are visible if they're questing in the same region, and they glow with their faction's color. When you see those outlines, you can cast a blessing or a curse that will load their games with speed/health bonuses or annoying extra baddies, respectively. You have to accept such perks and hindrances from other players in kind. Additionally, the territories you've claimed for your god in the single-player game will sometimes be \"challenged\" by other players, and you're asked to set your current quest aside and defend them (you can easily ignore these challenges and simply forfeit your territory without much issue). This launches one-on-one online duels that play out\u00a0with no latency issues to speak of in my testing. Mixing up weapon combos, magic blasts, blocks, and dodges with the few evenly matched opponents I've faced so far have proven memorable. The only problem is that an evenly matched opponent is nearly impossible to find. This partly comes down to iffy matchmaking, since the fighter with a higher level or better loot will score the victory almost automatically. But the game's free-to-play economy makes no bones about one frustrating basic fact: If you pay, you will win. Ascend 's economy puts a price on just about everything. True, you can't buy weapons that are beyond your experience level, but that's a fairness fakeout, because purchasable upgrades and perks will absolutely bump your power, speed, defense, and recharge abilities insanely high for about 30 minutes at a time. Those passive multiplayer blessings and curses also cost in-game money, so if you want to wreak a ton of havoc or sow a bunch of favor, it will cost you. To its credit, Ascend does a decent job doling out enough of the game's \"soul\" currency to keep players plenty capable of buying above-adequate gear and a few perks here and there, with some in-game money left in the bank. There's plenty of loot in dungeons as well, though it's usually in a worn-out state that costs souls to \"repair.\" The game has a few weird kinks at the moment. For one, the \"ascend\" mechanic asks players to retire their Caos and build a new one from scratch periodically in exchange for a higher level cap on the new warrior. Restarted warriors don't rewind in quest progress, and they default to a reasonably high level anyway, with a few perks for the restart, too. Mostly, the mechanic seems built to sneak a few more microtransactions into the game\u2014pay enough souls and you can transfer even more of your older weapons and armor to your new Caos! Hmm... More troubling is the ability to absolutely run past scores of enemies in the game whenever you please. If you simply dash through a crowd of baddies, they won't do much chasing. This leads to the unintentionally hilarious discovery that opening chests will make a player invulnerable to attacks, meaning you can dash through dungeons, scoop up loot, and leave pretty much unscathed. (A lack of penalty for deaths doesn't help this, either.) As such, the \"beta\" tag is very operative here. Still, while the enemy variety is a little weak, the solid battling mechanics and fantastic art design make this far from a free-to-play throwaway. The game can seem a little needy with the microtransactions, but the core gameplay honestly doesn't seem like it was built with squeezing money as the primary driver (with the exception of \"ascending,\" anyway). That means there's little reason for gamers on a budget not to dive in and get a good bit of loot-battling under their belts. The Good You won't need to spend a single dime for a pretty decent loot-driven battle spree For a console Diablo -like, it's certainly better than Too Human The Bad Slim enemy selection A few egregious microtransaction imbalances, especially in multiplayer The ugly You can run past scores of enemies with little in the way of punishment Quirks from the game's \"beta\" state will make you feel dumb if you actually pay to play Verdict: Definitely dive in for free, at least for a lark", "lede": "Game Details Developer: Signal Studios Publisher : Microsoft Stud...", "link": "http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/ascend-hand-of-kul-review-free-to-pray/"}, {"author": "Kyle VanHemert", "title": "Watch: A Kinect-Powered Orchestra You Conduct by Waving Your Hands", "feed_title": "Wired Top Stories", "updated_at": "2013-10-03 16:45:00", "content": "Could a symphony orchestra keep it together without the guy in the penguin suit waving his hands around in front of them? Probably. But with the Computer Orchestra , a project by a trio of students at ECAL, an arts and design school in Switzerland, the human conductor\u2019s presence is vital. In fact, since all the players are laptops, the conductor is the only human involved. It\u2019s a chance to see how easy it really is to do the job. The project, created by Simon de Diesbach, Jonas Lac\u00f4te, and Laura Perrenoud, involves one conductor, one Kinect, and up to 24 laptops each loaded with a single sample. Those fragments, which can be selected from a preloaded library or snapped up from an in-the-works crowdsourced platform, are triggered purely by the movements of the conductor\u2019s hands. Each instrument is mapped to a section of 3-D space \u2014 move your hands through them and the samples play; hold a hand in one zone and that computer will continue to play with increasing volume. It\u2019s a chance to see how easy \u2014 or, probably, how hard \u2014 it really is to do the job, though in this case the system was designed with harmonious output in mind. \u201cNo special skills are required to make a great performance,\u201d the students explain. \u201cAnyone could do it.\u201d But the project doesn\u2019t just re-imagine the orchestra from the conductor\u2019s perspective. It offers a unique listening experience, too. The designers hope to exhibit the project live at some point in the future, because seeing it in person, they say, is completely different than watching it on a screen. \u201cEach sound being played by one computer; it\u2019s an orchestra you can walk through, that you can experience from the inside,\u201d the team explains. \u201cThe sound will be completely different depending where you stand in the room.\u201d Getting all the components just right, from the motion detection zones to the overall sound design, was a challenge, but the hardest part was making the final video to show it off. \u201cWe had to borrow computers from friends, keep them charged all the day long, install the app on each post, build the setup \u2026 it was a huge mess to organize,\u201d they explain.
